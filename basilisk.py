# How many model round-trips a single user turn may chain through.  With
# read-only tools now batched (many lookups per round-trip), this budget
# stretches much further than it looks.  On hitting it Basilisk doesn't dead-
# end — it takes one final, tool-free turn to answer with what it gathered.
# The y/n confirmation gate and the catastrophic-command hard block still
# fire independently, so a high budget never means an unsupervised risky run.
# This 150-step cap applies only in a SUPERVISED (per-command approval) mode;
# it's overridable per-user via the "max_tool_steps" setting, and it resets
# every turn so "keep going" always grants a fresh budget.
MAX_TOOL_CHAIN = 150

# ANSWER MODE stall recovery: how many times a turn may be pushed after the
# model DESCRIBED its next action but emitted no tool call ("Let me grab the HN
# thread…" and then nothing).  Two is deliberate — one push covers the ordinary
# slip, a second covers a model that needed telling twice, and past that it is
# not going to act, so the turn ends rather than burning round-trips on
# narration.  The mission loop has always had this recovery; answer mode had
# none, which is how a research question ended on a promise instead of a report.
# THE COUNTER IS CONSECUTIVE, NOT CUMULATIVE — and that distinction is the
# whole difference between "it stops before it's finished" and an agent.
#
# The cap exists to stop a model that ONLY narrates. A model that narrates,
# gets pushed, then goes and RUNS SOMETHING is not that model — it is a model
# that recovered. Counting those pushes cumulatively meant a job of any real
# length spent its whole budget early and then died silently at the first
# stall after it: a repo task that stalls at step 3 and again at step 40 had
# already used both nudges on step 3, so step 40 ended the turn with the work
# half done and nothing said about it. The doubling for work turns below was a
# patch on that arithmetic rather than a fix for it.
#
# So _feed_tool_result — the one choke point every real tool result passes
# through — resets this to zero. Real progress clears the stall record.
ANSWER_STALL_NUDGE_MAX = 2
# …and an absolute ceiling still bounds the pathological case: a model that

# to foresight's deterministic rules, which are local pattern matching and take
# microseconds.  The catastrophic floor at the execution primitive is separate
# and always applies.

# genuinely died.
#
# The value is chosen so it CANNOT fire on real work: the longest hard timeout
# estimate_runtime hands out is 1800s, and tool_run_command enforces it, so any

   primary (suggested-action) surfaces use the coral itself (#c15f3c, one shade

/* ---- WHY THE 60px INSET LIVES HERE AND NOT ON THE BUBBLE ----
   Both bubbles used to carry the inset themselves:

       .msg-user      { margin: 8px 12px 8px 60px; }
       .msg-assistant { margin: 8px 60px 8px 12px; }

   and that one-sided margin is what made text spill out of the bubble
   background. Each bubble is halign:START/END with hexpand:false, so GTK
   allocates it its NATURAL width -- but the height-for-width query that
   decided how TALL to make it was answered for a different, wider size.
   A margin of 12 on one side and 60 on the other widens that disagreement
   by 48px, and on the steep part of a wrapped list's height curve 48px of
   width is ~200px of height.

   Measured on a real reply (eight wrapped bullets, 810px window): the
   bubble asked for 1593px, was given 1394px, and drew its last ~200px of
   text below its own background -- which is exactly what "text is flowing
   out of bubbles" looks like. The same 200px inflated the scroll range, so
   finishing a reply jumped the view to a bottom that was mostly empty.

   Moving the inset one level up fixes both: the column is a plain
   hexpanding box, so its margin cannot disagree with anything, and the
   bubble's own margin is symmetric. The rendered inset is unchanged --
   12 + 48 is the 60 it always was. */

   BUBBLES -- last layer, so it wins.

   CALM, NOT DIM. The previous pass stacked six shadows per bubble: two
   inner glows, an outer ring, a drop shadow and a coloured halo, on top of
   two radial gradients and a linear one. Every element was individually
   defensible and the sum was a screen where nothing sat still and long text
   had a permanent orange haze behind it.

   What actually separates a bubble from the background is ONE clear edge
   and ONE soft drop shadow. That is what is left here. The ember identity
   moves to where it costs nothing to read: a tinted border, a barely-there
   top highlight, and a hover state that lifts. No halo behind body text, no
   text-shadow smearing 30px glyphs, no gradient competing with the words.

/* =====================================================================
   OBSIDIAN GLASS  -  Aero-over-obsidian theme overlay
   =====================================================================
   Appended LAST so every rule here wins the cascade over the base theme
   and over the HELLFIRE ember overlay above it.  ASCII-only, like the
   rest of this bytes literal.

   The idea: the app is a sheet of dark glass laid over the dragon-ring
   artwork.  The WINDOW is opaque (nothing punches through to the
   desktop); everything INSIDE it - bubbles, sidebar, header, composer,
   cards, tables, popovers - is translucent, so the same backdrop shows
   through all of them and they read as one pane of glass instead of a
   stack of separate slabs.

   Every glass surface is built from the same four layers, in this order,
   which is what keeps them looking like the same material:

     1. background-color : rgba tint  - the smoke in the glass
     2. background-image : a top-down gloss ramp  - the Aero highlight,
        bright at the top edge, dead flat by the 52% line, faintly dark
        below it.  This is the single most recognisable Windows 7 cue
        and it is why these panels read as glass rather than as flat
        transparency.
     3. border          : a hairline of warm near-white at low alpha  -
        the polished edge that catches light
     4. box-shadow      : inset white top line (the bevel), an inset
        ambient darkening, then OUTER shadow + a red bloom picked from
        the artwork's neon.

   Do not "simplify" a panel by dropping layer 2 or 4: without the gloss
   the surface goes muddy, and without the bloom it detaches from the
   backdrop and floats.

   EVERY TINT IS WARM ON PURPOSE.  The first cut of this theme used a
   neutral steel rgba(235, 236, 237) for the highlights and a blue-black
   rgba(20, 20, 21) for the smoke, and the result read GREY - the glass
   went the colour of a stainless-steel appliance and fought the red art
   behind it.  The whites here are pushed towards #f8f8f8 and the smoke
   towards a red-black #11100e, so the glass takes its colour FROM the
   backdrop instead of arguing with it.  If a surface ever looks grey,
   that is the bug, and the fix is to warm its tint - not to darken it.

   Palette lifted off the backdrop art:
     neon red   #95948e / #7d7d78      deep blood  #3e3c3a
     smoke      rgba(22, 11, 14, a)    lit edge    rgba(255, 238, 240, a)
     text       #f3f3f1   dim #b7b6b2  code #f3f2f0
   ===================================================================== */

/* ---- Base plate ------------------------------------------------------

   areas resolve to.  Near-black, with red pools so the corners of the

   Those are OPAQUE, and they sit above the backdrop overlay, which is
   why the first pass of this theme showed the art in the chat pane and
   nowhere else - the sidebar was a black slab with a translucent box
   painted on top of it.  Knocking both panes out to transparent is what
   makes the glass work at all; the visible tint comes from .sidebar and
   the panels themselves.  Do not put a colour back on these.

/* =====================================================================
   OBSIDIAN GLASS - PASS 2: the nameplate, the pill, the cut edges
   =====================================================================
   Appended after pass 1 so it wins where the two overlap.  ASCII only.

   Pass 1 made every surface translucent.  This pass gives the set its
   SHAPE.  Two rules carry it:

     - a CUT EDGE.  The reference look is armour plate, not a soft app
       card: the frame is a bright hairline with the corner radius kept
       small and uneven (a big radius on one corner, a small one on the
       next) so a panel reads as something machined rather than something
       rounded off.  GTK CSS has no clip-path, so the chamfer is faked
       with an asymmetric border-radius plus a second, brighter inset
       ring drawn 1px inside the first - which is what actually sells the
       bevel at a glance.

     - a LIT RIM.  Every framed panel carries a red bloom whose strength
       tracks how important the panel is: the hero card and an armed
       Unleash burn, an inactive button barely glows.  Nothing here is
       an animation - the app must stay perfectly still while idle.

/* =====================================================================
   COMPOSURE PASS - appended LAST, so it wins the cascade over every
   block above it.  ASCII-only, like the rest of this bytes literal.

   Everything here is about the difference between a UI that is DARK and
   one that looks EXPENSIVE.  Three things separate them, and the glass
   recipe above already gets the hard one (material) right:

     1. ONE LIT EDGE PER SURFACE, not a rim all the way round.  A closed
        loop of bright colour is a gaming bezel; light falls from one
        direction, so the bevel goes on the TOP edge and the rest of the
        outline stays a low-alpha hairline.  The outer accent blooms were
        damped for the same reason.
     2. CHROME RECEDES, CONTENT DOES NOT.  Labels, counters, timings and
        rules step back to the dim end of the ramp; the model's words,
        tables and code keep full contrast.  Before this, a step count
        and a finding were painted at the same weight.
     3. NO NESTED BOXES.  A card inside a card inside a panel is the
        single most common way a dense UI turns to mush - each border is
        another line competing with the text.  Depth is carried by tint
        and by one hairline rule instead.

/* ---- The live feed: a chip on the tray, a popover for the detail -----
   It was a full-width panel in a dock of its own between the last message
   and the composer, with a margin above AND below it - so there was a gap
   sitting there whether anything was running or not, and the controls
   read as three separate slabs stacked with air between them.

   It is a STATUS INDICATOR, so it is now the size of the other controls
   and lives on the same bar as them.  The detail opens over the
   conversation instead of reserving layout forever, which means the tray
   never changes height and there is no hole left behind when it closes.

/* =====================================================================
   THE QUIET PASS - appended after COMPOSURE, so it wins over everything.
   ASCII-only, like the rest of this bytes literal.

   The brief was "darker, more minimal, more professional".  The composure
   pass got the structure right; what was left is VOLUME.  Three specific
   things were still shouting, and none of them is the content:

     1. THE GROUND WAS NOT DARK, IT WAS DIM.  Surfaces sat around 4-6%
        lightness ABOVE the window, so every panel read as a lighter
        rectangle pasted onto the backdrop.  Dark UIs look expensive when
        the panels are DARKER than the frame and the only light in the
        room comes from the text.  So the grounds drop and the separation
        is carried by one hairline instead of by a lift.
     2. TINT WAS DOING WORK THAT CONTRAST SHOULD DO.  A blue-tinted panel
        next to a blue-tinted panel needs saturation to tell them apart,
        and saturation is the thing that reads as cheap.  Chrome goes
        near-neutral here; the cool band stays where it earns its place,
        on the lit edge and on live/active state.
     3. EVERY SURFACE HAD A DROP SHADOW.  A shadow means "this floats
        above that".  When everything floats, nothing does, and the whole
        window gets a soft halo that looks like a screenshot of a UI
        rather than a UI.  Shadows are kept ONLY where something really
        does float over content: the popover, the dialogs.

   WHAT IS DELIBERATELY NOT TOUCHED, because quiet is not the same as
   washed out: prose, code, tables and links keep their full contrast -
   they are the reason the window exists.  The semantic colours (error
   red, warning amber) are untouched, because dimming a danger signal to
   match a mood is how a warning stops working.

   THE SELECTED CHAT ROW was the loudest object in the window: a saturated
   blue fill, a 3px accent bar, a white top bevel AND an outer bloom, all
   on a list row whose job is to say "you are here".  Chrome receding is
   the rule, and a navigation row is chrome.  It keeps ONE signal - the
   left accent bar, which is the cheapest unambiguous "here" there is -
   and gives up the fill, the bevel and the glow.

   THE COMPOSER went too far the other way and nearly vanished: a dark
   rounded box on a dark ground with a 0.11-alpha hairline reads as
   nothing at all, and the one control the operator needs to find without
   looking should not be the hardest to see.  It gets a visible edge
   back - still quiet, still no bloom, but legibly an input.  Its FOCUS
   state stays understated, because the composer holds focus from the
   moment the app opens: a loud focus ring means the app's resting
   appearance is "something is shouting at you".

   It is a READING surface, not a control: no box, no tint, no border of

   and that is the entire chrome budget, because a bordered card inside
   the popover would be the nested box the composure pass exists to

   THE COLOUR PASS - appended last, so it wins over every pass above.
   ASCII-only, like the rest of this bytes literal.

   The passes before this one all traded colour away for calm.  The quiet
   pass, the last of them, deliberately made the chrome "near-neutral" and
   dropped the grounds to near-black - handsome, but it reads on screen as
   a black-and-white film: grey text on grey panels on a black ground with
   the coral accent barely visible anywhere.  This pass puts the colour
   back while keeping the structure and every contrast the calm passes got
   right.  It is a re-tint, not a re-layout: the only thing that changes is
   hue.

   The palette is a deep indigo ground, indigo surfaces one step lighter,
   coral as the primary accent and a violet secondary that actually reaches
   the screen (selection, focus, the operator's own bubble).  Green, amber
   and red stay semantic and stay where they were.

# writing a report replies with headings, bullets and quotes. All of it used to
# land in one Gtk.Label as literal text — `| Agent | Score |` and a row of
# dashes, rendered as prose. The pipes do not line up in a proportional font,
# so the single most common shape of a structured answer was also the least
# readable thing on the screen.
#
# These are parsed here, as pure functions over text, so the whole grammar is
# testable without a display. The widgets that draw them are further down.

# A table separator: |---|:--:|---:| — the row that makes a table a table.
# ONE dash is a legal separator cell: `|:-:|` and `|-|` are both valid
# markdown and both are things a model actually emits. Requiring two silently
# rejected every centre-aligned table — caught by tests/test_richblocks.py,
# not by reading. The "is this really a separator" judgement is finished in
# _looks_like_table, which also demands a pipe (or a long dash run), so a
# setext underline under a line of prose is not mistaken for one.

#  ...AND WHEN NOT TO. THE SUPPRESSOR.
# ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
# The marker list above only ever says YES. Every marker it gained to stop a
# missed fetch also made it fire on ordinary work, and nothing ever said no —
# so a question about the operator's own code went to DuckDuckGo. Measured on
# a corpus of fourteen plain coding questions, THIRTEEN forced a web fetch:
#
#   "explain the cost of a hash table lookup"          -> cost
#   "which python version does my pyproject require"   -> version
#   "refactor the price calculation in cart.py"        -> price
#   "why is worth() returning None in this file"       -> worth
#   "the news feed component in my react app is broken"-> news
#
# That is both halves of the complaint at once. It searches when it obviously
# should not, and because the promise gate then forces a fetch the turn cannot
# end where it should have ended — it answers, fetches, and comes back.
#
# THE RULE. Suppression needs POSITIVE EVIDENCE and can only ever downgrade a
# weak signal, never a strong one. It fires only when BOTH hold:
#
#   1. Nothing STRONG matched. "latest", "today", "who won", "weather",
#      "ceo of", "out yet" name the live state of the world and are never
#      suppressed, whatever else the sentence says.
#   2. The question has a LOCAL or CONCEPTUAL referent — it is about the
#      operator's own files, or it is a definition / how-to / build request.
#
# So the failure mode is asymmetric on purpose: a question with no local
# referent and no conceptual framing still fetches on a weak marker alone
# ("did they release nmap 8 yet"), because a needless fetch costs a round
# trip and a missed one costs a wrong answer.

# Unambiguously about the live world. Never suppressed.
# NOTE bare "news" is NOT here: "the news feed component in my react app" is a
# UI bug report. The news-shaped PHRASES are ("news today", "world news",
# "breaking news", "in the news"), and they are.

# ── THE PROMISE GATE, AS A PURE DECISION ─────────────────────────────
# Kept out of the 300-line stream-completion callback on purpose: this is the
# rule that decides whether the app goes and fetches something the model only
# promised to fetch, and a rule that important has to be readable and
# testable on its own, not inferred from a GUI callback.
#
# It answers ONE question: this turn is about to end — is it ending on an
# unkept promise? Two facts decide it, and neither is a phrase in the reply:
#
#   · the operator asked something that cannot honestly be answered from
#     training data (_needs_web_verification), and
#   · no web tool ran during the whole request.
#
# Every earlier fix for "it said it would fetch the news and then stopped"
# was a better reader of the reply — a stall-phrase list, a printed-URL
# recovery — and each one was one unseen phrasing away from failing again.
# This one does not read the reply at all.
# ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
#  THE VERIFICATION GATE — the promise gate, pointed at the other half
# ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
# WORK MODE's contract already tells the model, at some length, to run
# something that proves its change: "VERIFY, DON'T ASSUME", "ITERATE UNTIL IT
# ACTUALLY PASSES". That is advice, and advice is exactly what a model drops
# on step forty of a long job. Anthropic's own write-up of this names the
# failure and the fix in one line:
#
#     "Claude stops when the work looks done. Without a check it can run,
#      'looks done' is the only signal available, and you become the
#      verification loop."
#
# and separates the two mechanisms: a prompt instruction is advisory, a Stop
# hook is deterministic and "blocks the turn from ending until it passes".
#
# Basilisk already HAS the check — `workspace_verify` re-runs the repo's tests
# and classifies the result against a baseline, so it reports what you fixed
# AND what you broke. The gap was never the check. It was that nothing made
# the turn go through it.
#
# So this is the promise gate's exact architecture aimed at the other half of
# the product. Same shape, same reasons:
#
#   · it does NOT read the reply. Every earlier attempt at "did it really
#     finish?" was a better reader of the model's prose, and each was one
#     phrasing away from failing. Two FACTS decide this: files were written
#     this request, and nothing was ever run to check them.
#   · it fires at most ONCE per request, and after it fires a verifier HAS
#     run, so the condition cannot re-arm. A floor, not a loop.
#   · it is pure and total. Junk in, None out - a gate that raises is a gate
#     that fails open on exactly the turn it exists to catch.
#
# WORKSPACE writes only. `workspace_write`/`workspace_replace` can only
# succeed with a repo open, which is what makes `workspace_verify` applicable;
# a bare `write_file` outside a workspace has nothing to re-run.
_WORKSPACE_WRITE_TOOLS = frozenset({
    "workspace_write", "workspace_replace", "workspace_revert",

# the model. `run` counts: a model that ran its own test command has verified
# its work, and insisting on our tool instead would be ceremony.

#  WHICH ACTIONS CHANGE THE ANSWER OTHER ACTIONS WOULD GIVE
# ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
# Fed to ActionLog.record so the repeat guard counts a WINDOW rather than a
# lifetime. Its docstring carries the reproduction; the short version is that
# the guard compared labels, so it could not tell a scanner re-run (nothing
# changed, refuse it) from a verifier re-run after an edit (everything
# changed, that IS the job) — and it was refusing the second one from the
# third call onwards, for the life of the chat, while the persona was telling
# the model "workspace_verify. Every time."
#
# MEMBERSHIP RULE: a tool belongs here if running it could make a LATER,
# DIFFERENT action return something else. Writes, deletions, moves, command
# execution, arming and firing, recording evidence, changing scope. A pure
# read — status, tree, search, read, verify, score — does not, and must not
# be here: an action never resets its OWN window (see record), so adding a
# read here would only let it excuse OTHER actions' repeats.

#  THE SECOND ANSWER — why a gate has to say this
# ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
# Both end-of-turn gates fire at the same moment: the model has written a
# COMPLETE reply, emitted no tool call, and the turn was about to end. The
# gate then runs a tool anyway and hands the result back.
#
# From the model's side that is indistinguishable from an ordinary mid-
# research tool result — so it does the only sensible thing and writes the
# answer. The answer it already wrote. The operator, who cannot see any of
# this machinery, gets two complete answers to one question and reasonably
# reports that the app "sends two answers".
#
# The gates were right to fire. What was missing is the one fact only the
# host has: THE FIRST ANSWER IS ALREADY ON SCREEN. Said plainly, the
# continuation becomes what it should always have been — a delta. A line
# confirming the check, or a correction if the check changed the answer.
#
# It is deliberately blunt and deliberately short. This rides the volatile
# trailing message, it is read immediately after a tool result, and the
# competing instruction it has to beat ("answer the operator's question")
# is the strongest one in the prompt.
_GATE_CONTINUATION_NOTE = (
    "\n[system note — READ THIS BEFORE YOU WRITE ANYTHING: the reply you "

    "question again, do not restate your conclusion in different words, and "
    "do not re-summarise what you already said — that is the same answer "
    "twice and it reads as a stutter.\n"
    "Reply with the DELTA and nothing else:\n"
    "  · the check agreed with what you said -> one short line confirming "
    "it, naming what was run or read. Two sentences at most.\n"
    "  · the check CONTRADICTS or changes what you said -> say so plainly, "

# ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
#  THE LEDGER GATE — the turn may not end on work it said it would do
# ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
# The promise gate asks "did it fetch what the question needed?". The
# verification gate asks "did it check the change it made?". Both read
# facts rather than prose, and both were built because a reply-reader kept
# being one phrasing away from wrong.
#
# This one asks the remaining question: "did it do what IT SAID IT WOULD?"
# — and it is the only one of the three that can answer in BOTH directions,
# which is why it fixes two complaints at once:
#
#   items still open  -> the turn does not end. This is the "it stops when
#                        it's supposed to keep working" half. A reply like
#                        "I've fixed two of the five files" reads as a
#                        conclusion to every prose detector ever written,
#                        and is plainly unfinished to a ledger.
#   nothing open      -> the turn DOES end, and every other push is
#                        suppressed for the rest of the request. That is
#                        the "it doesn't stop and sends two answers" half:
#                        once the declared work is done, the host stops
#                        finding reasons to hand the model another turn.
#
# BOUNDED, like every other gate here. A model that will not close an item
# must not be able to hold a turn open forever, so after `cap` pushes the
# gate stands down and says so. An empty ledger is NOT "complete": a job
# with no plan is unmanaged, not finished, and this gate says nothing about
# it either way.

#     decode, arriving in 9ms chunks exactly when each new bubble appeared —
#     which is a hitch the operator sees rather than a number in a profile;
#   · opening a chat is worse, because _load_chat builds the whole window at

# SIGNAL HANDLERS ARE WHAT KEPT EVERY BUBBLE ALIVE FOREVER
# ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
# `dispose_widget()` on every widget class below nulls its Python attributes
# and its callbacks, and the docstrings say that "breaks any reference cycle
# so CPython reclaims the widget". It did not, because the cycle does not run
# through those attributes -- it runs through GObject:
#
#     MessageWidget -> speak_btn (a child)      [Python -> C]
#     speak_btn     -> its signal closure       [C]
#     closure       -> the lambda / bound method[C -> Python]
#     lambda        -> MessageWidget            [Python]
#
# CPython's cyclic collector cannot see the middle two hops, so the loop is
# never broken and nulling attributes changes nothing. Measured on the real
# app: 120 exchanges with a hard 20-row display budget left 130 MessageWidgets
# and 120 CodeBlockWidgets alive -- exactly one leaked per assistant message,
# each still holding its Pango layouts, textures and TextViews. That is the
# unbounded memory growth (and the slow, laggy scrolling) that only shows up
# in long conversations. With the speak button's handler removed the same run
# stayed flat at 20.

        three write `_content` into the store and into the history that is
        re-sent to the model on every later turn — so all three must fold the
        model's native dialect to the canonical form first.  Only the finish
        path did.  A stopped or errored turn wrote raw `<｜DSML｜｜tool …>` into
        the database, and strip_tool_calls' own docstring spells out the cost:
        every later turn re-sent that garbage as history, wasting context and
        teaching the model the broken format was acceptable.

        Doing it here, on the attribute rather than on a caller's local, is what
        makes `_content` canonical for EVERY later reader — renderer, store, and
        the per-message speak button all read it directly.

        _normalise_tool_syntax is idempotent (locked by tests/test_toolsyntax),

    # value from BEFORE the new bubble was laid out — GTK has not re-measured.
    # So the view jumped to the old bottom and the newest message sat below the
    # fold, half-hidden behind the composer. It got worse the taller the new
    # message was, which is why it looked like a "long conversation" bug: a
    # one-line reply happened to fit, a reply with a table or a code block did
    # not. Anything that changes height AFTER layout — an image finishing its
    # load, a table reflowing, streamed text rewrapping — reopened the same gap.
    #
    # The fix is not a longer timeout, it is to stop guessing when layout is
    # done: hold a STICK flag and re-snap on the adjustment's own `changed`
    # signal, which GTK emits every time upper/page-size move. The flag clears
    # when the operator scrolls up himself and re-arms when he comes back down,
    # so following the tail never fights him.

        timeout times the fallback chain length, i.e. minutes.  The call now
        runs on a worker, the wait carries the deadline, and blowing it SETS THE
        CANCEL EVENT so the socket is actually abandoned rather than left to
        finish into a buffer nobody reads.

    # a mission continue, up to 60s for an error back-off) the app reported
    # itself idle while a turn was definitely still coming.
    #
    # Two ways that produced a duplicate answer, both reachable by hand:
    #
    #   · the operator types a follow-up during the window. _is_busy() says
    #     no, the message is accepted and kicks a turn -- then the orphan
    #     timeout fires and kicks a SECOND one. Two live streams write
    #     through the same self.streaming_msg_widget, so the tokens
    #     interleave and both finalisers commit.
    #
    #   · the operator presses Stop and then sends. _request_stop set
    #     _stop_requested, which is the only thing _kick_assistant_turn
    #     checks -- but _send_user_message clears that flag on entry, so the
    #     orphan timeout sails through the one guard that would have caught
    #     it. Stop did not stop it.

        Every tool runs on a daemon thread, and before this helper existed each
        one was individually responsible for making sure a result came back.
        Several did not: `tool_run_command` (the hottest path in the app),
        `tool_list_dir`, `tool_find_file` and `tool_write_file` were all called
        with no exception handling, and their results indexed with `r['rc']` /
        `r['entries']` / `r['size']` rather than `.get`.  An OSError spawning a
        process, a KeyError on an unexpected result shape, a UnicodeDecodeError
        on binary output — any of them killed the worker thread silently, no
        tool result was ever fed, and the turn sat in "working…" forever with no
        way out but restarting the app.

        `body(feed)` receives a ONE-SHOT feed callable.  Whatever the body does
        — returns without feeding, raises halfway, feeds and then raises —
        exactly one result reaches the model, so the loop always advances and
        the failure is something the model can read and route around.

        #     `force_confirm` flag, stored it on self as `_fs_force_confirm`,
        #     and then no code anywhere ever read that attribute — so foresight
        #     printed an alarming card and ran the command regardless.  A safety
        #     layer that logs and proceeds is not a safety layer.  A block now
        #     actually refuses, AND the refusal is fed back as a tool result so
        #     the model can pick a different approach instead of the turn simply
        #     dangling with nothing to answer.
        #
        #  2. The assessment had NO deadline.  With the optional model pass on,
        #     `_ext.foresight()` makes a full network round-trip; if that hung,
        #     `_resume` never ran, the command never executed, no tool result was
        #     ever fed back, and the whole turn sat in "working" until the app
        #     was restarted.  The assessment is now watchdogged: if it does not
        #     land inside `foresight_timeout_s`, we proceed on the deterministic
        #     rule floor (instant, local, and the part that actually carries the
        #     safety weight) and say so in the log.  Latency never wedges a turn.
        #
        #  3. Re-entrancy rode on an INSTANCE flag (`_fs_cleared`) that was
        #     cleared in a `finally` the moment `_execute_command` returned —
        #     which is long before the command it started has finished.  The

            the verdict — lives at the END, so a head-only cut reliably keeps
            the preamble and drops the answer.

        The budget is unchanged; this spends it better and says clearly that

    """Startup splash: the chat-background dragon, dark, with a band of light
    that sweeps UP from the bottom to its head — when the light reaches the top
    the whole dragon is lit, then it fades and the main window opens behind it.

    Entirely self-guarding: every path is wrapped so that ANY failure (no cairo,
    no pixbuf, a draw error, an old GTK) just fires on_done and closes, so the
    app always opens normally. It is NEVER allowed to wedge startup.

    THE `import cairo` PROBE BELOW IS LOAD-BEARING, AND THE try/except INSIDE
    _draw DOES NOT COVER IT. When pycairo is absent, PyGObject cannot marshal
    the Gtk.Snapshot's cairo context into the Python callback at all: it raises
    `TypeError: Couldn't find foreign struct converter for 'cairo.Context'` in
    the BINDING layer, before a single line of _draw runs. So _draw's own
    try/except never sees it, the splash paints nothing, and stderr gets that
    line at 60fps for the whole animation. Measured in this sandbox, which has
    GTK4 but no pycairo — exactly the shape of a box that installed via
    install.sh, because that script installs python3-gi/gtk4/libadwaita and
    (until now) never installed the cairo binding.

    The claim in this docstring was false for the one failure mode it names.
    Probing up front is what makes it true."""
