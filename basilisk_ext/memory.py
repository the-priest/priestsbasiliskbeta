"""
memory — persistent, relevance-scoped recall for Basilisk.

The "Honcho concept" without the service or the GPU.  Design goals, in order:

  1. Recall by RELEVANCE, inject a handful, never the whole store.  That is
     the answer to "don't bloat the token window": history can grow forever,
     but each turn only ever sees top-k (default 6) memories scored against
     the current message.
  2. Run on a phone.  Default scorer is keyword (FTS5 if present, LIKE if
     not) + recency + salience — zero model compute, instant.  Embeddings are
     OPTIONAL: if the host injects an embed_fn, recall upgrades to cosine.
  3. No hidden side-channel.  One SQLite file at a path the operator owns,
     a settings toggle, and a memory_forget tool.  Nothing leaves the box
     except the same API calls Basilisk already makes.

Storage model (one table, deliberately boring):

    memories(id, ts, kind, text, salience, source, embedding)
      kind     : fact | preference | event | fix | skill_note
      salience : 0..1, how strongly to favour it in recall
      source   : 'heuristic' | 'model' | 'tool' | 'manual'
      embedding: packed float32 blob, or NULL in keyword mode

        #
        #   1. `CREATE VIRTUAL TABLE IF NOT EXISTS` SHORT-CIRCUITS on a table
        #      that already exists — sqlite never loads the fts5 module, so it
        #      does not raise.  The try/except below therefore could not detect
        #      a missing fts5 on an EXISTING db, and left self._fts wrongly True.
        #   2. The mem_ai/mem_ad triggers live in the DB schema, not in this
        #      process.  They survive whether or not this interpreter can use
        #      fts5 — and a trigger whose target table is unusable fails the
        #      statement that fired it.
        #
        # So a memory.db created where fts5 exists, then opened where it does
        # not (a phone, a rebuilt python, a synced data dir — exactly the case
        # this module's own docstring anticipates), made EVERY `INSERT INTO
        # memories` raise "no such module: fts5".  remember() propagated it,
        # observe_turn() let it through, and record_turn() swallowed it into a
        # log file: memory silently stopped persisting while the feature still
        # looked enabled.  The worst failure shape there is.
        #
        # Fixed at both ends.  Here: probe by TOUCHING the table, and if it is
        # unusable drop the triggers so writes cannot be taken down by it.  In
