foresight — predict the consequences of an action before it runs, and judge
whether it should.

This is the part that takes LeCun's complaint seriously inside the narrow
world Basilisk actually operates: a shell on one machine.  Basilisk can't model
physics, but it CAN model "what does this command do to this system, is it
reversible, how big is the blast radius, and does that match what the operator
seems to want."  The output enriches the confirmation card and can hard-block
catastrophes even in auto mode.

Two tiers:

  1. DETERMINISTIC rules (always on, free, instant).  Pattern-match the
     command against known-catastrophic and known-risky shapes.  These set a
     FLOOR: a rule-block cannot be argued down by the model.
  2. MODEL pass (optional).  If a completer is supplied, ask it to predict
     consequences as structured JSON.  It may ESCALATE a verdict (allow->
     caution, caution->block) but never DE-escalate below the rule floor.
     Fail-open on error (returns the rule verdict) so a flaky model never
     blocks legitimate work.

Verdict the host acts on:
    allow   — run normally (still subject to the operator's confirm gate)
    caution — run allowed, but the card shows the predicted consequences and
              undo hint; in auto-mode the host SHOULD still confirm these
    block   — refuse to run even in auto-mode; require an explicit override

# Each rule carries the KEY of its own undo hint (or None when the action has no
# honest undo — a hard kill loses unsaved state, an unaudited script has already
# run, a recursive chown has no generic inverse).
#
# The undo used to be looked up by scanning the whole command string for any
# tool name in _UNDO_HINTS and taking the first dict-order hit. That is the same
# defect twice over. It fired on names that were merely MENTIONED — `killall -9
# apt` and `chown -R apt:apt /srv/thing` were both offered "reinstall with: apt
# install <pkg>", and `git_reset` matched any command containing the letters
# g-i-t, including `rm -rf /var/log/digital-archive` and anything mentioning
# "legitimate". And it could not see the rule that actually fired, so dict order
# decided ties. A wrong undo is worse than none: it reads as "this is
# recoverable" at the exact moment the operator is deciding whether to let a
# risky command run. Tying the hint to the rule makes a mismatch unrepresentable
# — there is no string to re-scan and no order to depend on.
#
# COVERAGE, likewise, was one-sided: _UNDO_HINTS carried pacman and dnf entries,
# but the only package-removal RULE was apt's. So foresight cautioned on Debian
# and stayed silent on Arch, Fedora, openSUSE and raw rpm — `sudo pacman -Rdd
# glibc` came back a plain "allow". The hint table was the evidence of intent;
# the rule table just never caught up.
