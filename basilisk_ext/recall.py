recall — what has already been done this mission, and whether we are going
round in circles.

WHY THIS EXISTS
===============
Basilisk repeated itself.  Not "twice in a row" repeating, which the old
loop-breaker in basilisk.py already caught, but the harder kind: re-running
something it had already run three or four steps earlier, with other actions in
between.

That is not a model quirk, it is an information problem, and it was created by
the host:

  * The model's only record of its own actions was the transcript.
  * `_build_history_for_model` keeps just HISTORY_KEEP_FULL_TOOL_RESULTS (2)
    tool results at full length and cuts everything older to a 600-char head.
  * `headroom.compress_messages` then compresses what survives that.
  * And the mission-continue directive re-anchors every turn on the ORIGINAL
    objective — "take the very NEXT concrete action toward: <objective>".

So several steps in, the strongest thing in the model's context is the original
objective, and its evidence of having already tried something is a truncated
stub.  A model in that position re-runs the obvious first move.  It is behaving
correctly on the information it was given.

The fix is to give it the information.  This module keeps ONE LINE per action —
the action, and a digest of what came back — outside the transcript, so it is
never trimmed and never compressed.  Forty actions cost a few hundred tokens,
which is far less than one re-run of a scan.

The deterministic guard (`should_block`) is the backstop for when the model
ignores the list anyway.

DESIGN CONTRACT
===============
Same as the rest of basilisk_ext: this module imports NOTHING from basilisk.py,
basilisk_core.py or basilisk_persona.py.  It is pure data + string handling and
is unit-testable on its own.  If it fails to import, the host degrades to the
old behaviour rather than breaking.

        `limit` is the number of executions permitted, so the default of 2

        after changing something is how verification works — `systemctl status
        x`, then `systemctl start x`, then `systemctl status x` again is correct
        behaviour and must not be blocked.  A THIRD identical execution is not
        verification; by then either it already worked or it never will, and
        either way the result is not being read.

        Read the name literally — "block after this many runs".  An earlier
        draft had the docstring promising the third would be refused while the
        arithmetic permitted a fourth, which is the kind of off-by-one that
        makes a guard look present and do nothing.

        A run whose result was destroyed in transit (compressed to a stub,
        trimmed away, returned as an unhydrated cache reference) does NOT
        count towards the limit: from the model's side that action never
        produced anything, and refusing the retry strands it — it cannot get
        the data and cannot ask again.  That is a delivery failure being
        reported as a reasoning failure.

        A ceiling still applies (UNUSABLE_GRACE extra attempts), because
        "the result was unusable" must not become an unlimited retry licence.

        ── AND IT COUNTS A WINDOW, NOT A LIFETIME ──────────────────────
        The paragraph above is right about a SCANNER and wrong about a
        VERIFIER, and the difference had shipped: nmap against the same host
        three times tells you nothing new, but `workspace_verify` after a
        third edit tells you something completely new, because the thing it
        is measuring changed underneath it.

        The guard could not tell them apart — it compared labels — so it
        blocked the exact loop the product is built around. Reproduced:
        `workspace_verify {}` takes no arguments, so its label is the constant
        string "workspace_verify", and the third call in a repo job was
        refused, and every one after it, for the life of the chat (the log is
        only reset when a MISSION latches, which never happens in leashed work
        mode). Meanwhile the persona says of that same tool, in the model's own
        instructions: "Call after every edit", and "6. workspace_verify. Every
        time." The instructions mandated a behaviour the guard forbade. Same
        for `run: pytest -q`, for `oracle_status {}` ("Consult it every
        planning turn"), and for every other no-argument status read.

        So the count is runs of this action SINCE THE LAST DIFFERENT
        STATE-CHANGING ACTION. Checked against every shape I could construct:

            verify, verify, verify              -> blocked at 3   (nothing changed)
            edit, verify, edit, verify, edit…   -> never blocked  (correct loop)
            nmap, nmap, nmap                    -> blocked at 3   (unchanged)
            pytest, edit, pytest, edit, pytest  -> never blocked  (correct)
            pytest, pytest, pytest              -> blocked at 3   (same code)

        times_run/times_delivered still report LIFETIME totals, because that
        is what the refusal message quotes back and "you have done this twice"
        has to stay literally true.
