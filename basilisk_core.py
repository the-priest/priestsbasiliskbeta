# workhorse money (0.15/0.50 against V4-Flash's 0.13/0.28), natively
# multimodal, and 1M context. DeepSeek-V4-Flash stays SECOND so a GLM outage
# lands on the model every README benchmark was produced with, and stays in
# the catalogue unchanged — the benchmark rows and their v7.6.0 labels record
# which build produced which score and are NOT restated as GLM numbers.
# ── THE PIN WENT BACK TO DEEPSEEK, AND HERE IS WHY ──────────────
# The pin moved to GLM-5.3-Flash at v1.0.0.18. Everything that broke after it
# was GLM behaviour, not app behaviour: the reasoned-but-silent retry loop, the
# JSON-bodied <tool_call> that neither ran nor stripped, the reasoning read out
# loud, and — worst — the model WRITING ITS OWN TOOL RESULTS, inventing a fetch,
# a status code and a page body. Every one of those is fixed and GLM is fully
# supported, but they were all shipped to an operator who had not chosen GLM.
#
# The benchmark settles it. 87/113 was produced on DeepSeek-V4-Flash, and the
# operator re-ran the board on v1.0.0.17 — also DeepSeek — and got 87 again,
# challenge for challenge, no regression. That is the configuration with a
# measured score behind it.
#
# ── v1.2.0.0: THE DEFAULT MOVED TO DeepSeek-V4.1-Flash, AT HIS INSTRUCTION ──
# He asked for V4.1-Flash (DeepSeek's Sep-2026 refresh, confirmed live on
# SiliconFlow) added and made the default. It is the SAME VENDOR and the same
# tool-call dialect as V4-Flash — DeepSeek's own platform routes the old
# v4-flash id to V4.1 — so everything that makes V4 work (the DSML/native
# canonicaliser, enable_thinking) applies unchanged. Two things make this a
# safe default rather than a blind one:
#   · V4-Flash is chain[1], the IMMEDIATE fallback, so the measured 87/113
#     build is one hop away and its benchmark rows/labels are NOT restated as
#     V4.1 numbers — nobody has run the board on V4.1 yet.
#   · the backend recovers from a wrong model id: a 404/400 refetches the
#     provider's live /models and walks to a real one, so even if SiliconFlow's
#     exact slug differed, a fresh install degrades to V4-Flash, never dies.
# This is NOT an auto-hop: it is the operator changing the shipped default,
# which he is entitled to do. Existing installs keep their saved siliconflow_
# model, so anyone who measured on V4-Flash stays on V4-Flash.
#
# GLM-5.3-Flash stays in the catalogue and one click away in the model
# picker, with every GLM fix intact. Choosing it is one setting; being moved
# onto it without asking is what the earlier revert was about.

# the only lever that worked. That is exactly what the previous comment here
# said, and it was true when it was written.
#
# GLM-5.3-Flash CHANGED IT. Its model card states three levels — low | high |
# max — and, in the sentence that matters, that it "defaults to `max` if not
# passed (OR IF SET TO ANY OTHER VALUE)". Both halves of that bite:
#
#   * NOT PASSING the field is not neutral. It selects `max`, the deepest and
#     slowest mode. The old mapping sent reasoning_effort ONLY on High, so the
#     Low rung — which is the SHIPPED DEFAULT, and whose tooltip promises
#     "Low is fastest and cheapest" — sent no effort field at all and ran the
#     model at maximum depth. Two of the pill's three rungs did the OPPOSITE of
#     what they say, and the one an operator never touches was the worst.
#   * "medium" is NOT in the enum, so sending it verbatim would also fall back
#     to max. The pill's rungs are a UI vocabulary and must be TRANSLATED to
#     whatever the model actually accepts, never forwarded raw.
#
# So the mapping is per family, and both are sent: reasoning_effort is what
# GLM's own runtime reads, thinking_budget is what SiliconFlow's layer reads,
# and they agree in direction. A provider that rejects either 400s once, and

#  THE PLACEHOLDER WRITE — the one that destroys code and reports success
# ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
# A model writing a whole file sometimes writes the part it changed and then
# a comment standing in for the rest:
#
#     def add(a, b):
#         return a + b
#     # ... rest unchanged ...
#
# That is not an abbreviation, it is a DELETION. Every function below the
# marker is gone, the write returns ok:True, and the model reports the edit
# as done. The operator finds out when something else breaks.
#
# WORK MODE's contract warns about it twice, in capitals — "NEVER write
# `# ... rest unchanged ...` ... that DELETES the omitted code". That is
# advice, and this is the same lesson as the verification gate: the model
# was told, and the write still lands. So it is a gate.
#
# THE RULE NEEDS ALL THREE CONDITIONS, and the third is what makes it safe:
#   1. the file ALREADY EXISTED (a new file has nothing to lose),
#   2. the new content carries a placeholder line — a whole line whose only
#      content is a stand-in, not a sentence that happens to mention one,
#   3. and the file SHRANK to under 60% of its lines.
#
# Measured before shipping: 9/9 real truncation shapes caught; 0 false
# positives over all 108 source and markdown files in this repo rewritten
# byte-for-byte, over honest 80% deletions with no marker, over a document
# discussing patching in prose, over files under 12 lines, and over a write
# that ADDS a marker line without shrinking.

    true of ONE primitive.  `tool_launch_app` is a second one — it takes a
    model-supplied program and argument string, builds an argv, and Popens it
    detached — and it called neither gate.  So while

        run("rm -rf /")                     was refused by the floor,
        launch_app("rm", "-rf /")           spawned it, as root, ungated,

    and `launch_app("nmap", "<out-of-scope-host>")` walked straight past the
    authorisation boundary that exists precisely to stop that.  Both gates were
    correct; only one of the two doors had them fitted.

    An inlined block can only ever protect the function it is inlined in, so
    the rule now lives in one place and every primitive calls it.  Anything
    added later that spawns a process from model input must call this too —
    tests/test_gates.py asserts the set of callers.

    # That is fail-CLOSED and therefore not a security hole, but it turns a

    # silent in stretches) from `curl https://dead.host` (25 minutes of
    # nothing), so it killed both at the same number.
    #
    # Second and worse, the TimeoutExpired handler discarded the output.
    # CPython populates TimeoutExpired.stdout with every byte the process
    # wrote; the old handler never read it. A scan that enumerated 200 hosts
    # and then hung on the last one reported NOTHING — so the agent re-ran the
    # whole scan. That is the "it times out and it's back to 0" failure, and it
    # was a thrown-away-data bug wearing a timeout costume.
    #
    # unblock.run_supervised watches PROGRESS instead: output arriving, or CPU
    # advancing across the process group. Any sign of life resets the stall
    # clock, so there is no limit on how long real work may take. When
    # something genuinely stalls it tries to UNSTICK it first — the commonest
    # real stall is a process blocked on an interactive prompt, which a
    # timeout can only kill but closing stdin actually releases — and if that
    # fails it harvests every byte captured so far and hands it back marked
    # partial, with a diagnosis the model can act on.
    #
    # `timeout` is retained in the signature for callers and tests, but is NOT
    # a wall clock any more: it only raises the stall thresholds for commands
    # the runtime estimator already expects to be long-running, so a slow job
    # is given more patience before we even start calling it stuck.

# ── A BARE PARTICIPLE IS A PROMISE WITH THE PRONOUN DROPPED ──────
# Every marker above needs a subject ("I'll", "let me") or the literal word
# "now" glued to the verb ("fetching now"). Models drop both constantly, and
# the reply still ends the turn holding a promise:
#
#     "Okay - fetching the news now."          <- "fetching now" does NOT
#     "Okay. Fetching."                           match; the words are apart
#     "Right, checking the RTE page."
#
# Reported from a live run as "says okay it'll fetch the news then stops and
# says done without fetching". Measured: 2 of 15 realistic announce-and-stop
# phrasings were invisible to the stall check, so no nudge fired and the turn
# died silently — the same dead end the answer-stall nudge exists to close.
#
# Anchored to a CLAUSE START (start of text, or after . ! ? : ; , - and
# friends) so "the fetching logic" mid-sentence is not a promise. Deliveries
# are protected downstream, not here: reply_is_bare_stall still requires that
# NOTHING was delivered, so "Fetching the feed returned 503." keeps its
# report and is not nudged.
# A COMMA IS NOT A CLAUSE BOUNDARY HERE. The first version allowed one, and
# caught the participle in "The scan found 1 live host, 192.168.1.1, running
# nginx 1.24 with ports 80 and 443 open" — a finished report graded as a stall
# and nudged, which is the same "same answer twice" bug in the other
# direction. A mid-sentence participle is a MODIFIER; an announcement opens
# its own clause. So: start of text, or after a sentence terminator or dash —
# and a comma only when it follows a bare acknowledgement ("Okay, searching
# now."), which is the one shape where a comma really does start one.

    ── THIS USED TO BE A THIRD DESTRUCTIVE PRIMITIVE WITH ITS OWN, WEAKER,
       HAND-WRITTEN FLOOR ──

    gate_command's own docstring says the destructive floor exists because
    "an inlined block can only ever protect the function it is inlined in ...
    every primitive calls it". `delete_path` / `move_path` / `copy_path` are
    primitives, and they called neither gate_command nor
    is_catastrophic_command -- only an exact-membership set of eleven
    strings. Anything not literally in that set walked through:

        rm -rf /usr/bin                      -> REFUSED by the shell floor
        delete_path{"path":"/usr/bin",       -> {"ok": true, ...}
                    "recursive":true}           and shutil.rmtree runs

    Confirmed with rmtree stubbed: /usr/bin, /home and /var/lib were all
    reached. /home, /opt, /srv, /etc/ssh, /var/lib and every other critical
    path outside those eleven strings had the same gap.

    The set was also partly dead. It is compared against `realpath`, and on
    every usr-merged distro -- Debian 12+, Ubuntu, Arch, CachyOS, Fedora,
    i.e. all the ones this app targets -- realpath("/bin") is "/usr/bin",
    which is not in the set. So "/bin", "/lib" and "/sbin" protected nothing;
    they were the pre-merge names being compared against post-merge values.

    The fix is not a longer list. It is to ask the SAME question the shell
    floor asks, so a path the operator cannot delete with `rm -rf` is not
    deletable through a tool call either. The list stays as a cheap
    fast-path and a floor of its own if that ever regresses.

    The previous version called `ufw status`, `iptables -S`, and `nft

    the audit ran as the regular user (the normal case) every command
    returned permission-denied, the script fell through to the final
    "No firewall detected — HIGH" branch, and the user got told their
    system was open even when it wasn't.

    New approach: ask systemd first.  `systemctl is-active <unit>` is
    readable by any user and tells us whether the firewall *service*
    is up.  Then check ufw.conf for the boot-time enable flag.  Only
    after that do we try the privileged inspectors — and if they fail
    we report uncertainty rather than asserting absence.

# WRITING A BIG FILE — WHY IT FAILED EVERY TIME
# ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
# Reported as: "writing big code fails every time, it has to do it in tiny
# sections".  Two independent causes, both of which had to be closed.
#
# CAUSE 1, and the one that made SMALL writes work: _loads_lenient repairs
# literal control characters inside a JSON string, and NOTHING else.  Its
# docstring calls a multi-line `content` "the one mistake models make most" —
# but the mistake models actually make on a FILE body is an unescaped inner
# double quote, and almost every real file has one (`print("hi")`, a dict
# key, a docstring).  Measured on the shipped parser:
#
#     literal newlines only          -> repaired
#     unescaped inner quotes         -> None  -> {"_raw": …} -> no card
#     newlines AND quotes (any code) -> None  -> {"_raw": …} -> no card
#
# Size was never the variable; QUOTE DENSITY was.  A three-line snippet with
# no quotes went through, a three-line function with a `print("…")` did not,
# and a 400-line module always contains one — so it looked exactly like "big
# writes fail", and chopping the file into tiny sections made each section
# likely enough to be quote-free (or short enough for the model to escape
# by hand) that the workaround appeared to work.
#
# json.loads cannot be made to do this: once a quote closes the string early
# the rest of the object is garbage to it.  So the value is taken
# STRUCTURALLY — find the key, take everything to the terminator, decode the
# escapes that ARE there — which is what a human reads it as.
#
# DELIBERATELY NARROW: only for the write tools, only after strict AND
# lenient parsing have both failed, and only when what is left over on either
# side is itself valid JSON.  A body that parses normally never reaches here.

# ── TOOL-SYNTAX NORMALISATION ────────────────────────────────────────
# TOOL_TAG_RE only matches `<tool ...>`. Everything else a model might emit —
# and they emit plenty — parsed to ZERO calls, which meant the text was neither
# executed NOR stripped, so it leaked into the chat as raw garbage and the turn
# ended with nothing to run. That is the "why is it printing DSML nonsense
# instead of searching, and why does it stop" failure.
#
# The worst offender is the model's OWN native format. DeepSeek emits function
# calls as special tokens built from FULLWIDTH VERTICAL LINE (U+FF5C) and LOWER
# ONE EIGHTH BLOCK (U+2581):
#
#     <｜tool▁calls▁begin｜><｜tool▁call▁begin｜>function<｜tool▁sep｜>web_read
#     ```json
#     {"url": "..."}
#     ```<｜tool▁call▁end｜>
#
# In a font without those glyphs that renders as pipes and boxes — which is
# exactly what appears on screen. The model is not malfunctioning; it is using
# its trained tool syntax, and the host only understood one dialect.
_DS_PIPE = "\uff5c"          # ｜ FULLWIDTH VERTICAL LINE
_DS_SEP = "\u2581"           # ▁ LOWER ONE EIGHTH BLOCK

# ── THE SENTINEL'S PIPE IS NOT ALWAYS THE FULLWIDTH ONE ──
# DeepSeek's special tokens are written with U+FF5C, and that is what the
# official encoding spec shows:
#
#     <｜DSML｜tool_calls><｜DSML｜invoke name="x">…
#
# But the pipe DEGRADES on the way out. Deployments report the same block
# arriving as `<||DSML||tool_calls>` — ASCII, doubled — which is a tokenizer
# rendering difference, not a different protocol. The count varies too: the
# shape this project first captured had DOUBLED fullwidth pipes, the spec has
# single ones, and the field reports have doubled ASCII ones.
#
# That mattered because the whole DSML pass was gated on `_DS_PIPE in text`.
# With ASCII pipes the gate was false, the pass never ran, and the block was
# neither executed NOR stripped — so raw `<||DSML||invoke name="web_read">`
# printed into the chat. Reproduced verbatim from the field report before this
# was changed; it is the single largest cause of "V4-Flash isn't compatible".
#
# So: match a CLASS of pipe-shaped characters, any number of them, in any mix.
# Widened ONLY where the literal word DSML makes the match unambiguous — the
# generic `<｜…｜>` special-token stripper below stays fullwidth-only, because
# `<|x|>` in ASCII is a shape that can legitimately occur in prose and code.

# The SEPARATOR (U+2581 ▁) in `tool▁call▁begin` degrades the same way, most
# often to an underscore: `tool_call_begin`. And `_DEEPSEEK_CALL_RE` below —
# the OTHER native dialect, the one V4/V4.1-Flash actually emit — was still
# pinned to the one canonical pipe AND the one canonical separator. So the
# instant EITHER degraded on the wire (`<|tool_call_begin|>`, `<│tool▁sep│>`,
# doubled ASCII pipes, …) the call was neither parsed NOR recognised as a call:
# the tool never ran, the model got no result, and it re-tried the same call
# for ever — the "empty / said it would and didn't" loop, on BOTH DeepSeek
# models (it is their shared trained syntax, so the model id never mattered).

# name= attribute GLM never sends, so even where an opener DID match, the tool
# ran with EMPTY args and logged ✓ done. GLM-4.7 also allows the name on the

# behaving.  Under a forced or `tool_choice: required` call — and, per vLLM's
# own tracker (#48095), intermittently in ordinary agentic use — GLM 5.x
# instead writes an OpenAI-shaped JSON body inside the SAME wrapper, sometimes
# as a bare object, sometimes as an ARRAY of them, and sometimes with no
# closing tag at all:
#
#     <tool_call>[{"name": "run", "parameters": {"command": "git status"}}]
#     <tool_call>{"name": "run", "arguments": {"command": "id"}}</tool_call>

#     {"command": "id"}</tool_call>
#
# The name-before-<arg_key> rule cannot see any of these: the token before the
# first <arg_key> is the whole JSON blob, which is not an identifier, so the
# block was left exactly as it arrived.  That is the WORST of the two failure
# modes this file's DSML comment warns about — the call neither RAN nor got
# STRIPPED, so raw JSON was printed into the chat, written to chats.db and
# replayed as history every later turn, and the turn ended having done nothing.

# ── DSML: DeepSeek-V4's tag dialect ──────────────────────────────────
# The v9.1.0 normaliser knew DeepSeek's OLD token format (<｜tool▁call▁begin｜>
# … <｜tool▁sep｜>name … ```json …```).  V4 emits a DIFFERENT, XML-shaped
# dialect in which every tag carries a "DSML" sentinel built from the same
# FULLWIDTH VERTICAL LINE, and the arguments are CHILD TAGS instead of a JSON
# body:
#
#     <｜DSML｜｜tool name="run">
#     <｜DSML｜｜parameter name="command" string="true">curl -s …</｜DSML｜｜parameter>
#     <｜DSML｜｜parameter name="reason" string="true">why</｜DSML｜｜parameter>
#     </｜DSML｜｜invoke>
#     </｜DSML｜｜tool>
#
# Two things broke, and they produced two DIFFERENT symptoms in the same run:
#
#   1. When the sentinel was on the OPENER, TOOL_TAG_RE (`<tool`) never matched
#      — nothing executed and nothing was stripped, so the raw markup was
#      printed to the operator as chat text.  That is the pipes-and-boxes on
#      screen.
#   2. When the model happened to open with a plain `<tool name="…">` and only
#      the CHILDREN carried the sentinel, TOOL_TAG_RE matched, the body was not
#      JSON, and the whole thing landed in args as {"_raw": "<｜DSML｜｜parameter
#      name=\"url\" …"}.  The tool then ran with no url at all.  That is the
#      `web_read({"_raw":"<｜DSML｜｜parameter …` line in the log.
#
# Symptom 2 is the more dangerous of the pair: it looks like a working tool
# call, right down to the "✓ done", so the loop never notices it learned
# nothing and just tries again.
#
# The sentinel's pipe COUNT varies with how the tokenizer renders the special
# token, and on a closing tag the slash may sit either side of it — so match
# one-or-more pipes and accept a slash in either position rather than pinning
# the exact byte string seen once in one screenshot.

# THE MODEL WRITING THE HOST'S LINES
# ═════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
# Reported from a live GLM-5.3-Flash run, screenshot in hand: one question
# ("can you give me some news") produced a bubble containing the model's
# narration INTERLEAVED WITH TWO COMPLETE TOOL RESULTS —
#
#   Checking the two open cases first, then general news. Fetching updates on
#   both.[UNTRUSTED WEB CONTENT] Tool result (web_read - google_news): {...}
#   [END UNTRUSTED WEB CONTENT]
#   Verifying the arrest report on the RTE page itself before I call it.
#   [UNTRUSTED WEB CONTENT] Tool result (web_read): {...}
#
# — while the activity feed said `1 step complete`. The model wrote both sides
# of the conversation: it invented the fetches, the URLs, the HTTP 200s and the
# article bodies, and presented them as retrieved fact.
#
# THIS IS DETECTABLE WITH CERTAINTY, which is why it is handled here rather
# than left to the prompt. Every string below is emitted by the HOST and only
# by the host — webshield's envelope, the tool_result wrapper, the untrusted-
# data rules. Nothing in this application can put one of them inside an
# ASSISTANT message. So one appearing in model output is not ambiguous
# evidence, it is proof, and the right response is to delete the fabricated
# span before it can be rendered, stored, or replayed as history.
#
# WHY IT HAPPENS: tool results are fed back as `user`-role messages wrapped in
# this envelope. A model trained on a dedicated tool/observation role reads
# that as "the user writes tool results" and completes the pattern. Changing
# the envelope is the deeper fix and a dangerous one — nine places in
# basilisk.py test `"<tool_result>" in content` as a literal — so the envelope
# stays byte-identical and this catches the imitation instead.
#
# FOR A TOOL WHOSE PREMISE IS "NO PROOF, NO FINDING", a fabricated tool result
# is the worst reachable failure: it looks exactly like evidence.
# ── THE FIRST VERSION OF THIS LIST WAS A TEXT-EATING BUG ─────────
# It triggered on the bare phrases "BEGIN UNTRUSTED DATA" / "END UNTRUSTED
# DATA" and on a lone "<tool_result>". Those are things a model writes in
# ORDINARY PROSE while explaining itself, and because an opener with no closer
# was cut to end-of-buffer, one mention destroyed the rest of the reply:
#
#   "Summary of the engagement:
#    - BOLA on /api/users confirmed
#    - The response body contained BEGIN UNTRUSTED DATA which I ignored
#    - Recommend object-level authorisation checks"
#
# ...lost every line from the mention onward, AND tripped the forged-result
# retry, so the operator watched a finished answer vanish and regenerate.
# Measured on a prose corpus: 4 false positives, up to 144 characters
# destroyed each.
#
# The fix is to require the STRUCTURE, not a substring. A forged result is a
# whole envelope, and there are exactly two shapes of one:
#   * the banner, delimited by U+27E6/U+27E7 MATHEMATICAL WHITE SQUARE
#     BRACKETS — characters prose does not produce by accident;
#   * a <tool_result> … </tool_result> PAIR. A bare opener is somebody talking
#     about the tag, and talking about it is not forging one.
# BEGIN/END UNTRUSTED DATA are gone entirely: they only ever appear INSIDE an
# envelope whose banner already fires, so they added no detection at all and
# caused every false positive.

# operator reports as "when it searches it types in chat and it gets deleted".
#
# It also costs a second symptom that looks unrelated.  The chat bubble is
# attached lazily on the first token carrying visible TEXT, precisely so a
# tool-only step never draws an empty bubble — but a leaked `<too` IS visible
# text by that test, so the bubble pops IN for a step that will never say
# anything, then pops OUT again when the finished reply is judged a bare tool
# step.  One leak, three symptoms.
#
# The rule is the one every incremental parser uses: never emit a tail that
# could still turn into markup.  Hold it back; the next token either completes
# the marker (it is stripped) or proves it was prose (it is released, one frame
# later, which no reader can perceive).
#
# This is STREAM-ONLY on purpose.  A FINISHED message ending in "<t" is text
# and must be shown, so the hold must never be folded into strip_tool_calls
# itself.  Both paths still share one stripper, so a new dialect is taught to
# the app in one place and this function inherits it.

# Every marker opener the strippers downstream know how to recognise, lowercased.
# A tail that is a PREFIX of any of these has not finished arriving yet.
# Keep in step with TOOL_PARTIAL_RE, _ALT_OPEN_RE, _FUNC_OPEN_RE, _DS_OPENER_RE

    the reasoning and emits only the closer:

        The operator wants the host details, so uname is …</think>

        Running that now.

    Every consumer downstream of here is paired-tag based, so with no opener
    NOTHING matched: the entire chain of thought was shown as the reply, the
    literal `</think>` was rendered, TTS READ THE REASONING ALOUD, and the
    whole lot was written to chats.db and replayed as history on every later
    turn.  This is the same disease as the DSML speech bug — reasoning
    escaping into a channel meant for the operator — arriving through a
    different door.  Providers that run a reasoning parser split this into
    `reasoning_content` and it never reaches here; this is for the ones that
    do not.

    CONDITIONS, deliberately narrow — the counter-property here is a reply
    that merely MENTIONS the tag, and swallowing that reply's opening
    sentences into the reasoning panel would be a worse bug than the one being
    fixed.  So all three must hold:

      1. the closer is the FIRST think-tag event in the text (an opener before
         it means an ordinary paired block, already handled below);
      2. it sits OUTSIDE a ``` fence — a fenced example is the model showing
         the operator what the tag looks like;
      3. it is not written INLINE.  A chat template emits `</think>` at the end
         of the reasoning and then a newline (or nothing); prose writes
         "the tag </think> closes a block", with an ordinary space after it.
         So a following space/tab that is not a newline means prose, and the
