"""
basilisk_safety.py — the hard, setting-independent safety floor for the auto-run
gate.

Basilisk runs with root on the operator's own box and, in its default low-friction
mode, executes a model-issued `run` command without a card click.  That speed
is the product — but it means exactly one class of mistake (a wiped disk, a
nuked filesystem, the immutable guardrail shell-stripped out of Basilisk's own
source) must be caught *before* it executes, no matter what the "confirm every
command" setting says.  These two predicates are that floor:

  • is_catastrophic_command — would this irreversibly destroy the system or its
    storage?
  • command_tampers_self    — would this write to Basilisk's own source, bypassing
    the guarded edit path (ast gate + immutable GUARDRAIL block)?

A True from either forces an explicit confirm dialog in basilisk.py's gate; it is
never silenced by a setting.

Why this is its own module, and why it is *structural* rather than a raw-string
regex.  A model ingests untrusted text (web pages, scan output, READMEs) that
can try to steer it, so the detector has to survive trivial obfuscation that a
naive substring/regex match misses:

    rm '-rf' /            # quoted flag
    rm${IFS}-rf${IFS}/    # $IFS instead of spaces
    cd / && rm -rf *      # the root target is in a *prior* sub-command
    find / -delete        # no `rm` token at all
    bash -c "rm -rf /"    # the real command is a -c payload
    echo x | base64 -d | sh   # opaque: we can't see what runs

The approach: normalize ($IFS → space), split on shell operators, shlex-tokenise
each sub-command (which strips quotes for free), recurse into `sh -c` / `eval`
payloads, and classify by the *resolved argv* — not by how the string looks.
The classifier is a strict SUPERSET of the old regex's catches (no safety
regression) and stays deliberately narrow: ordinary offensive-security work
(nmap, nuclei, sqlmap, hydra) and file ops in your own dirs (rm -rf ~/loot,
rm -rf ./build) do not trip it, so it adds no friction to real work.

Pure stdlib (shlex, re, os).  GTK-free and import-free of the rest of Basilisk, so
it is trivially unit-testable offline — see tests/test_basilisk.py.

#
#     X=/; rm -rf "$X"            <- verified UNREFUSED, and verified to

# for the VERB: a body-scan cannot help, because the variable's VALUE is what
# runs. The answer there was to reason about what the shell produces, and it is
# the answer here too — substitute the literal assignments the command makes to
# itself, then re-scan.
#

#   * only `VAR=literal` assignments written in this same command string;
#   * only unquoted / simply-quoted literals with no expansion of their own,

#   * a bounded number of variables and one extra scan, so a pathological
