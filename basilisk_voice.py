basilisk_voice — speech in / speech out for Basilisk.

Two halves, both self-contained (stdlib only, no GTK, no third-party
Python packages required at import time):

  • SpeechToText  — record the mic to a temp WAV with whatever CLI
                    recorder the box has (parecord / arecord / ffmpeg),
                    then transcribe it through Groq's OpenAI-compatible
                    Whisper endpoint (reuses the operator's existing Groq
                    key — fast, accurate, no model download).

  • TextToSpeech  — a queue-backed worker that speaks text out loud.
                    Prefers Piper (local neural voice, sounds good) and
                    falls back to espeak-ng (always-available, robotic).
                    Fully interruptible: stop() drops the queue and kills
                    whatever is mid-sentence.

  • SpeechStreamer — turns a growing stream of assistant tokens into a
                    sequence of complete, speakable sentences while
                    skipping fenced code blocks, so TTS can start talking
                    before the model has finished writing.

Nothing here talks to the rest of the app except through the small
`get_settings` callable handed to the constructors, so it stays easy to
test in isolation and impossible to wedge the UI thread.

# that never went through the canonicaliser, so a DeepSeek-V4 `<｜DSML｜｜tool …>`
# call reached the speaker intact and PIPER READ THE SENTINEL OUT LOUD.
#
# The rule this encodes: a machine-readable tag is NEVER something a human is
# meant to hear.  If protocol markup somehow reaches the last common ancestor of
# every spoken line, the right outcome is that the words vanish — silence is a
# recoverable failure, reciting transport internals at the operator is not.
#
# Deliberately shape-based rather than a copy of the core dialect table: this
