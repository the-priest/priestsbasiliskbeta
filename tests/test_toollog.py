test_toollog.py — the terminal must say what actually happened.

WHY THIS EXISTS
===============
This suite is the second half of the DSML bug, and it is the half that made the
first half take so long to find.

The reported failure was that Basilisk printed protocol markup instead of
searching Steam. The parser fix is pinned in test_toolsyntax.py. But the
operator's log — the only instrument he had — was lying to him in three
separate ways at the same time, and every one of them pointed AWAY from the
real cause:

  1. `→ running <lambda>…` on every line.  `_tool_simple` took its label from
     `fn.__name__`, and 150 of the 151 dispatch entries wrap the call in a
     lambda to bind its arguments.  So the log could not tell you WHICH tool
     ran, which is the first question you ask.

  2. `✓ done` after a tool that failed.  The tick was printed unconditionally,
     so a `web_read` that came back with no url and an error read exactly like
     a successful fetch.  The run looked healthy while nothing was being
     learned — the same lie the parser bug told, told again one layer up.

  3. `── forcing the final answer (empty reply)` when the actual problem was an
     unreadable tool call.  The label had two branches for three cases, so at
     the exact moment the log had the answer, it named the wrong thing.

  4. The status line printed twice in a row, because `_set_working` logs on
     every call and is called more than once per tool with the same label.

None of these is a crash. All four are the reason a fifteen-minute bug took an
afternoon. A log that is wrong is worse than no log, because you believe it.
