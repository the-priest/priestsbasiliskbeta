test_guiwiring.py — GUI bugs you can only find by RUNNING the thing.

WHY THIS EXISTS
===============
Every bug pinned here was invisible to the rest of the suite, because the rest
of the suite never builds a real window. They were found by launching the real
app headlessly against a seeded conversation and looking at what it drew and
what it printed to stderr:

  1. `Gtk.Button(label=" Listen")` followed by `set_icon_name(...)`. set_icon_name
     REPLACES the button's child, so the label was silently discarded and the
     read-aloud control rendered as a bare icon circle floating under the reply,
     attached to nothing. Nothing errored. It just looked broken.

  2. The chat watermark: a bright 2MB photographic PNG at opacity 0.5 with
     ContentFit.CONTAIN. Contain letterboxes a landscape image inside a tall
     chat pane, so the art appeared as a glowing BAND across the middle with
     plain background above and below it — it read as content someone had
     pasted into the conversation rather than as a backdrop, and it fought
     every line of text over it.

  3. Overlay scrollbars float ON TOP of content, so the rightmost thing in a
     row — the user's avatar — was drawn underneath the scrollbar.

  4. libadwaita warned 25 times in a 16-state sweep that the window "does not
     have a minimum size". Without one there is nothing for the adaptive
     machinery to break against, so a narrow window can squeeze children past
     their own minimums, which is how widgets end up overlapping.

  5. THE ONE THAT WOULD HAVE SHIPPED: pycairo is a HARD dependency (pyproject
     declares it) and install.sh — the recommended path, the one the README
     documents — never installed it. Without it PyGObject cannot marshal a
     cairo context into a Python draw callback AT ALL: it raises
     `TypeError: Couldn't find foreign struct converter for 'cairo.Context'`
     in the BINDING layer, before a line of the callback runs. So DragonSplash's
     own try/except never saw it, its docstring's promise to degrade gracefully
     "if no cairo" was false, the splash painted nothing, and stderr took that
     line at 60fps for the whole animation.
