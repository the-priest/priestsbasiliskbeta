test_packaging.py — pyproject.toml must keep telling the truth about the repo.

WHY THIS FILE EXISTS
====================
This project already learned what an unchecked file manifest costs.  install.sh
lists the sidecar modules to fetch, and a module added to the repo but not to
that list is simply ABSENT on a remote install — no error, just a feature that
isn't there.  tests/test_sidecar_store.py pins that list now.

pyproject.toml is the same manifest problem with a wider blast radius, because
a wheel is what a stranger installs:

  * `py-modules` is written out explicitly rather than auto-discovered.  That
    is deliberate — auto-discovery on a flat layout sweeps up tests/ and any
    stray top-level .py — but it means a new basilisk_*.py module is silently
    DROPPED from the wheel, and the app ImportErrors on someone else's machine.
  * `package-data` globs by extension.  Add a .webp to the art and it silently
    does not ship; the app falls back to no icon and nobody finds out.
  * The version is written twice (here and basilisk.VERSION) because reading it
    dynamically would make the BUILD import basilisk.py, which imports gi at
    module scope — you would need GTK installed just to learn a version string.
    Two copies of one fact is the defect shape this codebase keeps finding, so
    it gets pinned instead of trusted.
  * Dependencies are declared by hand.  A new unguarded `import requests` at
    module scope is a broken install for everyone who doesn't happen to have it.

Every check below is derived FROM THE REPO, so it fails when reality moves and
the manifest doesn't.  None of it imports basilisk.py — that needs GTK.
