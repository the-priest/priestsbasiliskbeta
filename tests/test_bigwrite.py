"""
test_bigwrite.py — "writing big code fails every time, it has to do it in
tiny sections".

FOUR bugs sat behind that one sentence, and only one of them was about size.

1. QUOTE DENSITY, NOT SIZE.  _loads_lenient repairs literal control characters
   inside a JSON string and nothing else, so an unescaped inner `"` — which is
   to say any real code — put the whole call in {"_raw": …}. A three-line
   function with a print() failed exactly as reliably as a 400-line module;
   tiny sections only "worked" because they are short enough to hand-escape.

2. THE REPLY WAS CUT OFF AND NOBODY LOOKED.  finish_reason was never read, so
   a call truncated at max_tokens was reported to the model as a SYNTAX
   problem — and the model re-sent the same oversized call into the same cap.

3. THE FILE BODY WAS INTERPRETED.  In the `<parameter>` dialect V4-Flash
   emits, _coerce_param turned config.json's contents into a dict and a file
   holding `42` into an int, so the write raised TypeError; it also .strip()ed
   the body, so such a file could never end in a newline.

4. A FILE CONTAINING `</tool>` cut its own call short.

Plus the floor: write_file was the one write primitive with no _fs_guard.
