test_browsersearch.py — the real browser behind web_read, and real search.

THE TWO THINGS THIS PROTECTS
============================

1. THE SSRF FLOOR, INSIDE A BROWSER.
   urllib fetches ONE url and the caller checks each redirect hop. A
   browser follows its own redirects, loads subresources, and runs script
   that can fetch anything it likes — so the floor has to apply to EVERY
   request the page makes, not to the one we typed. It is also INJECTED,
   never reimplemented: browser.fetch refuses to run without a host_ok
   predicate, so there is exactly one definition of "private address" in
   the tree and no second copy to drift.

   VERIFIED AGAINST A REAL BROWSER during development, not reasoned about:
   a page whose <img> and whose fetch() both point at 169.254.169.254 has
   both requests aborted and both reported in `blocked`.

2. THE THREAD-AFFINITY TRAP, which would have shipped.
   Playwright's sync API pins every object to the thread that made it, and
   Basilisk dispatches each tool call on a FRESH daemon thread. The obvious
   implementation — launch once, keep it in a module global — works for the
   first web_read of a session and dies on the second with "cannot switch
   to a different thread (which happens to have exited)". Reproduced before
   the fix; the owner-thread design is why it now survives. "Works once,
   then breaks" is exactly the shape that gets shipped, because the happy
   path in a fresh session is the path anyone testing it takes.
