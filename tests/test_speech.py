test_speech.py — what the operator HEARS must be the reply, and only the reply.

THE REPORTED FAILURE
====================
Two symptoms, one disease:

  1. "it says dsml"  — the speaker read `<｜DSML｜｜tool name="run">` out loud.
     The operator was right that those letters are nowhere in the reply: they
     are in the TRANSPORT, and the transport was being spoken.

  2. "it speaks its thoughts" — after finishing the reply the speaker went back
     and read the model's <think> chain-of-thought, then repeated the reply.

THE ROOT CAUSE
==============
Basilisk canonicalises model output ONCE, at the boundary, and every consumer
is supposed to sit downstream of that: parse_tool_calls normalises before
matching, set_content renders from the normalised text, the stored message is
the normalised one.  README states the invariant outright.

Speech was the ONE consumer still sitting UPSTREAM of it.  So it had grown its
own, dialect-blind stripping in basilisk_voice, and:

  • the TTS suspend guard asked `"<tool" in content` — a literal substring that
    is FALSE for `<｜DSML｜｜tool …>`, `<invoke …>` and `<function=…>` — so on
    those dialects it never fired and the speaker ran straight through the call;
  • SpeechStreamer tracks a prefix ACROSS CALLS, and the GUI fed it
    think-stripped text per token but the RAW final text at flush.  Two
    different strings, so the line bookkeeping indexed into the wrong one and
    re-folded lines that were never new — the chain-of-thought.

Both are contract failures, not missing patterns.  So the fixes are structural:
speakable_text() is the single transform (mirroring the display chain exactly),
contains_tool_markup() is dialect-blind, SpeechStreamer CHECKS its contract
instead of assuming it, and basilisk_voice scrubs protocol at the one choke
point every spoken line passes through.
