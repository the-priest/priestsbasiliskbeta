test_persona.py — the persona is a SPECIFICATION, so treat it like one.

The persona is the single largest input to every turn, and nothing else in the
tree is checked less. Two failure modes matter and neither shows up as a crash:

  1. CONTRADICTION. Two blocks describing the same mechanism differently. The
     real one this suite was written for: CAPABILITIES said the
     system-destroying class was "always force-confirmed" while PERSONA_CORE and
     basilisk_core.tool_run_command said it is REFUSED OUTRIGHT with no override.
     A model reading both learns the floor is negotiable, and the confident
     wrong belief is worse than no belief — it will try to phrase around it.

  2. DRIFT BACK. The persona is edited by hand, often, and prose creeps. The
     things deliberately removed (biography, a stale hardware list, roleplay
     identity padding) are exactly the things that creep back.

So this file asserts the persona AGREES WITH THE CODE, agrees with ITSELF, and
stays inside its size budget. It is deliberately about invariants, not wording —
asserting exact sentences would make every legitimate edit a test failure, which
trains you to edit the test instead of reading the failure.

# contract. Every minute the prefix changed and the whole prompt was recomputed.

# the always-loaded core on purpose: they are worthless if the model has to
# know to go and find them.
#
# THESE ASSERTIONS CHANGED WITH THE SEARCH TOOLS. The old ones pinned the
# opposite fact — "There is no search tool", plus the hand-rolled
# html.duckduckgo.com URL and the JS-only warning that went with it. All
# three were true and are now false: web_search and web_research exist, and
# web_read renders in a real browser, so the JS-only subdomain advice is
# actively wrong. What has to stay pinned is the JUDGEMENT the old text was
# protecting — don't answer from a results page, don't search forever, go to
# the primary source, cite it — so those are asserted against the new
# wording rather than deleted.
