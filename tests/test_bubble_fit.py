test_bubble_fit.py — the bubble must be as tall as the text inside it.

REPORTED AS: "text is still flowing out of bubbles and shit".

A reply's last paragraph drew BELOW its own bubble background, on top of the
Listen button. It only appeared at the UI scales real machines use, which is
why three earlier layout sweeps missed it: every harness ran at the headless
default scale, where the same reply happened to fit.

THE MECHANISM. The bubble was built with

    inner.set_halign(Gtk.Align.START)
    inner.set_hexpand(False)

inside a VERTICAL box. A vertical GtkBox asks its child "how tall are you at
MY width", then -- because halign=START means "take your natural width" --
allocates it something narrower. The bubble's content is wrapped text and a
two-column list, so narrower means taller: it was sized from the answer to a
question about a wider box. Measured at ui_scale 0.5: allocated 490px, needed
576px, and 43px of text drew outside.

THE FIX. A HORIZONTAL box settles every child's WIDTH first and only then
asks for height, so the width the bubble is measured at is the width it gets.
The bubble now fills a hug row whose trailing spacer eats the slack -- the
same pattern the user row already used -- so a short reply still draws a small
bubble instead of spanning the window.

This test is GUI-level and needs GTK. It SKIPS (exit 0) where GTK or a
display is unavailable, so it never fails the suite for an environment
reason -- but where it can run, it runs the real app.
