test_truncwrite.py — a placeholder is not an abbreviation, it is a deletion.

THE BUG
=======
A model writing a whole file sometimes writes the part it changed and then a
comment standing in for the rest:

    def add(a, b):
        return a + b
    # ... rest unchanged ...

Every function below that marker is gone. Reproduced against the live
workspace: a 59-line file written as 3 lines with that comment returned
`ok: True`, and `def sub` was no longer in the file.

WORK MODE's contract warns about it twice, in capitals — "NEVER write
`# ... rest unchanged ...` ... that DELETES the omitted code". That is advice,
and the write still landed. Same lesson as the verification gate: the model was
told, so make it a gate.

THE RULE NEEDS ALL THREE, and the third is what makes it safe to ship:
  1. the file ALREADY EXISTED (a new file has nothing to lose),
  2. the new content carries a placeholder LINE — a whole line whose only
     content is a stand-in, not a sentence that mentions one,
  3. and the file SHRANK to under 60% of its lines.
