test_v1_regressions.py — the v1.0.0.0 bug set, each pinned by the property it
broke rather than by the line that broke it.

Every check below FAILS against v9.9.2. That is the bar: a regression test
that also passes on the broken build is documentation, not a test.

The set divides into two halves, and they came from opposite directions:

  · THE ANSWER ARRIVING TWICE. Four independent heuristics could each re-kick
    a finished turn, and none of them asked whether an answer had already been
    delivered. The operator asked one question and read the reply two or three
    times.

  · THE AUTHORISATION GATES FAILING OPEN. Clustered short options, awk/sed
    programs that spawn processes, and single-label hostnames each walked past
    a boundary that reported itself intact.

Run:  python3 tests/test_v1_regressions.py

# The host compares parse_tool_calls() against looks_like_failed_tool_call().

# call a tool and we could not read it", which injects a scold and re-kicks
# the turn. The model has nothing new to send, so it repeats its answer.
#
# The two predicates disagreed about fences: the parser masks them (a fenced
# tag is an EXAMPLE, not a call), the detector did not. So any reply
# containing a fenced tag -- or merely an HTML snippet with a name attribute,
# because one debris pattern is a bare `name="..."`> -- was treated as a
# failed call. Asking Basilisk to explain its own tool syntax did it every

# badge), not that the build is frozen at the version this suite was written
# for -- pinning that meant every later patch release started red.
# ...and "not frozen" has to mean ANY release, not just any patch of the one
# that happened to be current. This pattern was 1\.0\.0\.\d+, which is the
# same trap one component up: the 1.1.0.0 bump turned it red for no reason
# anyone could act on. Assert the SHAPE — a dotted numeric release — and let
# test_packaging be the thing that cross-checks the actual number against
# pyproject and the README badge.

# Reported from a real session, three turns running on one question:
#
#   "hi can you give me some recent news from ireland"
#   -> "Looking up recent Irish news. <url> Let's read the top result."
#   "why did u stop?"
#   -> "You're right, I never actually fetched it. Let me do it properly."
#      ... and the same reply again.
#   "you didnt do it agasin."
#
# No tool ever ran. parse_tool_calls found nothing (the URL is prose, not a
# tag), looks_like_failed_tool_call found nothing (there is no protocol to
# see), and reply_is_bare_stall said DELIVERED -- because the preamble plus
# the URL cleared the 80-character substance bar. So no recovery, no nudge,
# and the turn ended "done" holding a promise.
