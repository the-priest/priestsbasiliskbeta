test_glm.py — everything that is specific to running Basilisk on GLM-5.3-Flash.

Four seams, each of which was broken and each of which the existing suites
could not see:

  1. THE JSON-BODIED <tool_call>.  GLM's chat template usually emits
     <arg_key>/<arg_value> pairs, which the host already understood.  Under a
     forced call — and, per vLLM issue #48095, intermittently in ordinary
     agentic use — it instead writes an OpenAI-shaped JSON body inside the same
     wrapper, sometimes as an array, sometimes with no closing tag.  The
     name-before-<arg_key> rule saw a JSON blob where an identifier should be,
     left the block alone, and the call then neither RAN nor got STRIPPED: raw
     JSON printed into the chat, stored in chats.db, replayed as history.

  2. THE ORPHANED </think>.  GLM's thinking cannot be disabled and its template
     opens the <think> block in the GENERATION PROMPT, so the model's own
     output starts inside the reasoning and emits only the closer.  Every
     consumer here is paired-tag based, so nothing matched: the chain of
     thought was shown as the reply, the literal </think> was rendered, and TTS
     read the reasoning out loud.

  3. reasoning_effort.  GLM-5.3-Flash's card says the field is low|high|max and
     "defaults to max if not passed (or if set to any other value)".  Omitting
     it is therefore a CHOICE — the deepest and slowest one — and the pill's
     Low rung (the shipped default) omitted it.

  4. THE WALL-CLOCK CUT.  STREAM_MAX_WALL_S ends a runaway turn, which a
     deep-reasoning model is the thing most likely to trigger, and the cut was
     reported to nobody: finish_reason stayed empty, `truncated` came out
     False, and an unfinished reply was stored as a finished one.

Counter-properties are asserted as hard as the properties: prose must not be
parsed as a call, a reply that merely MENTIONS </think> must not be split, and
none of it may cost text on screen or turn linear work quadratic.

# 6. THE TURN THAT THINKS AND SAYS NOTHING
# ═════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
# The reported loop, verbatim from the operator's terminal:
#
#   stream start / stream done / response looked degraded (empty/repetitive)
#   auto-retry 1/3 ... 2/3 ... 3/3 / forcing the final answer (empty reply)
#   ...and again, for ever.
#
# The retry re-sent the SAME request to a model whose thinking cannot be
# disabled and which, with reasoning_effort omitted, runs at maximum depth: a
# deterministic budget failure, retried deterministically. So the recovery has
# to CHANGE the request — shorter thinking, more room for the answer — and it
# has to be able to tell that case apart from genuine junk output.
