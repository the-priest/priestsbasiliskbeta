test_toolargs.py — an argument the tool cannot see must never be silently
dropped.

FROM THE OPERATOR'S OWN TOOL AUDIT (2026-08-11)
===============================================
He ran Basilisk against its own tool surface and logged, among others:

    copy_path path=/etc/hostname   ->  ok:false, "source not found" with an
                                       EMPTY path string
    scan_net  target=127.0.0.1     ->  scanned 100.85.0.1/24 instead — the
                                       Proton VPN subnet — and reported success
    cve_lookup CVE-2024-3094       ->  ok:false, "no product"

Three different tools, one bug. Every handler in the dispatch table reads its
arguments with `a.get("src")` / `a.get("cidr")` / positional `product`, so a
key the tool does not know is INVISIBLE and the call proceeds on defaults.

The failure modes get worse down that list:
  * copy_path reported "source not found", which reads like the FILE is
    missing rather than like the argument never arrived — so the model
    "corrects" the wrong thing;
  * cve_lookup reported "no product", which reads like NVD had no data;
  * scan_net ran an ACTIVE SCAN of a network nobody named. On a pentest tool
    a silent default is not a no-op, it is unrequested traffic aimed at a
    third party.

THE FIX
=======
One normalisation step at the single dispatch choke point:
  * common synonyms are mapped onto the real key, but ONLY when the real key
    is absent, so a correct call is never rewritten; and
  * a call whose keys are ALL unknown is refused with the accepted names fed
    back, so the model re-issues it — the same "an unreadable call costs a
    round trip, never a wrong action" rule the tool-dialect handling uses.

The accepted names are parsed from the PERSONA SPECS — the very text the model
is shown — so the validator and the contract cannot drift apart. A
hand-maintained second list is exactly the failure this codebase keeps hitting.
