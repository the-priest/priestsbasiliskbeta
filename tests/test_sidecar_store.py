test_sidecar_store.py — memory recall, source verification, and the install
manifest.  Three surfaces that shipped with no tests at all.

WHY THIS FILE EXISTS
====================
Test coverage has been the best predictor of where bugs live in this codebase,
and these were the modules with none.  Each defect below is the same shape the
rest of the suite keeps finding: ONE rule, TWO consumers, only one of them
wired.

  1. THE INDEX COULD VETO THE WRITE.  memory.py keeps an FTS5 index for fast
     keyword recall, maintained by two SQL TRIGGERS that live in the database
     file, not in the process.  Recall degrades gracefully without FTS5 — the
     module's docstring says so, because a stripped-down python may not have
     it.  Writes did not.  Open a memory.db created where fts5 exists on a box
     where it doesn't and every `INSERT INTO memories` raises through the still
     -present trigger; remember() propagated it and record_turn() swallowed it
     into a log file.  Memory silently stopped persisting while the toggle
     still read "on".

     Worse, it could not even be DETECTED: `CREATE VIRTUAL TABLE IF NOT EXISTS`
     short-circuits on an existing table without loading the module, so the
     probe in _init_schema never raised and left self._fts wrongly True.

  2. THE STEMMER EXCLUDED ITS OWN EXAMPLE.  _prefix_match's docstring offers
     'fix'/'fixed' as a case it handles.  Its floor was 4 characters, and
     _tokens() only ever emits 3+, so every 3-char token — fix, dir, log, run,
     sql — got no stemming at all.  _SYNONYM_GROUPS expands 'dir' into
     'directory' at the same time, so the two halves of recall disagreed about
     whether a 3-char token was a stem.

  3. A SCRATCH SET ESCAPED INTO THE RESULT.  verify() strips its scoring sets
     before returning, because a tool result gets serialised to the model and
     json.dumps() cannot encode a set.  The strip named "salient".  When the
     anchor channel was added for the CVE case it produced a SECOND set,
     "anchors", and the name-list did not know about it.  (verify.py is not
     currently wired into dispatch, so this is latent rather than live — but it
     ships, it installs, and it would crash the first turn it was used.)

  4. THE INSTALL MANIFEST HAD NO BACKSTOP.  install.sh lists the sidecar
     modules to fetch in `curl|bash` mode.  A module added to the repo but not
     to that list is simply absent on a remote install, and nothing anywhere
     said so.
