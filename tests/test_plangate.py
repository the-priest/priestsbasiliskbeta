test_plangate.py — the deterministic turn-ending gates, and the second answer.

THE THREE REPORTED FAILURES
===========================
    "it still sometimes stops when it's supposed to keep working"
    "it still doesn't stop when it's supposed to"
    "...and sends two answers"

REPRODUCED against the pre-fix tree, so these are measurements and not
opinions:

  * "I've fixed two of the five files. The remaining three need the same
    treatment." — reply_is_bare_stall says False (correctly: it announced
    nothing), reply_intends_action says False, reply_is_strong_conclusion
    says False. Nothing pushed, the turn ENDED, three files untouched.
  * A verifier that came back RED, followed by an honest paragraph about
    the tests being red, also ended the turn — v1.1.3.0 made the turn RUN
    the check and nothing made it care what the check SAID.
  * A complete answer + a gate-forced tool = the model writes the answer
    again, because from its side a forced tool result is indistinguishable
    from an ordinary mid-research one. Two complete answers, one question.

WHAT IS ASSERTED
================
The gates fire when they must, DO NOT fire when they must not (the
counter-property gets as many asserts as the property — a gate that will
not let a turn end gets switched off, and then it protects nothing), and
are total.
