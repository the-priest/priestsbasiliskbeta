test_promise_gate.py — "okay, fetching the news now." and then the turn ends.

THE REPORTED FAILURE
====================
Operator asks for the news. The model replies with a sentence saying it is
about to fetch it, emits no tool call, and the turn ends. Nothing was fetched.
Asking "did you do it?" starts a fresh turn that has no memory of the promise.

Reported four times. Each previous fix made the app a BETTER READER OF THE
REPLY:

  * reply_intends_action / reply_is_bare_stall  — a phrase list
  * printed_url_target                          — recover a printed link
  * the bare-participle stall clause            — "Okay — fetching the news."

Every one of them is one unseen phrasing away from failing again, which is
exactly what kept happening: each fix caught the sentence in the screenshot
and missed the next one.

THE FIX UNDER TEST
==================
A gate that does not read the reply AT ALL. It reads two facts the app owns:

  1. the operator's question needs a live source (_needs_web_verification),
  2. no web tool ran during the entire request.

If both hold when the turn is about to end, the app runs the search ITSELF and
hands the results back to the model. Wording cannot defeat it, because wording
is not consulted. It fires at most once per request, and once it has fired a
web tool HAS run, so the condition cannot re-arm.
