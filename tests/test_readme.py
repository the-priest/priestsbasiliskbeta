test_readme.py — the README is an INPUT, not just marketing.

PROJECT_SELF tells Basilisk that when the operator asks about its own version,
install command, changelog or capabilities it should `web_read` this file
rather than answer from memory. That makes every sentence here a belief the
agent will act on, and a stale README a source of confident wrong answers.

Three real ones this suite was written for, all found by checking prose against
the actual code rather than against other prose:

  · "Nothing runs until you click Apply" for self-written skills — skill saving
    went autonomous, so an agent reading that would wait for an Apply that never
    comes.
  · "web_read reads only from a fixed allow-list ... off-list URLs are refused"
    — any public host is reachable after a one-tap approval, and the README's
    own tier examples put exploit-db in the wrong tier.
  · A stale version badge and test count.

METHOD NOTE, learned the hard way twice: validate a checker against KNOWN-GOOD
input before trusting its verdict. The anchor slugger below reported all six nav
links broken until it was run against the previous README, which demonstrably
worked on GitHub — GitHub does not strip a heading before slugging, so an emoji
is dropped but the space it leaves becomes a LEADING HYPHEN. The links were
right and the checker was wrong. Likewise, matching README prose with a literal
string fails on markdown emphasis (`*only*`), so claim checks here match on
distinctive substrings, not whole sentences.
