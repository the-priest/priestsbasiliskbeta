"""
test_models.py — the provider model catalogue and everything that reads it.

WHY THIS FILE EXISTS: a wrong model id fails at RUNTIME, on the operator's
box, mid-engagement, as an HTTP 404 that looks like a network blip.  Before
v7.9.3 three of the six ids in SILICONFLOW_CHAIN were discontinued models
and nothing in 862 tests noticed, because nothing asserted anything about
the chain beyond "it is non-empty and starts with the pinned default".

This locks the structural properties that CAN be checked offline:
  * catalogue/chain separation (adding a pickable model must not lengthen
    the runtime fallback walk)
  * the pinned default is still pinned and still in both
  * no duplicate / malformed / obviously-stale ids
  * ordering: the picker sorts by curated tier, NOT by the old regex that
    parsed 'NNb' out of the id and scored DeepSeek-V4-Flash at 0.0
  * the live-catalogue filter drops embeddings/TTS/image models
  * knows() accepts catalogue models, so the effort escalation isn't a no-op

It cannot check that an id is currently SERVED — that needs the network and
an API key.  The ⟳ live-refresh in Settings is the answer to drift.
