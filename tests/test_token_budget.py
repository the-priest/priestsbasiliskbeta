test_token_budget.py — the operator pays for every token this app sends.

WHY THIS EXISTS
===============
Prompt size is the one cost that grows silently. Nobody adds 4,000 tokens in
one commit; it arrives fifty at a time, in edits that each look reasonable,
and the only place it shows up is a bill. So the shipped prompt gets a
ceiling, and the ceiling is a test.

Three properties are pinned here, all measured rather than reasoned about:

  1. THE SHIPPED PROMPT IS THE LAZY ONE. basilisk.py passes
     grouped=(not max_mode), and max_mode ships False — so the real prompt is
     the group-index form (~7.5k), not the every-spec-inline form (~12.4k
     leashed, ~24.2k armed). A change that flips that default, or that makes
     the grouped form stop being meaningfully smaller, is a silent 1.7-3x
     cost increase on every single turn.

  2. THE CACHEABLE PREFIX IS BYTE-STABLE. Providers cache by prefix match.
     Anything that varies per turn must sit at the END of the request or it
     truncates the cached prefix where it appears. A clock at position five
     once did exactly that, throwing away the discount on the whole prompt on
     every turn. Volatile content belongs in volatile_block, and nowhere else.

  3. THE PER-STEP ADDENDUM STAYS SMALL ON CONTINUATIONS. The addendum rides
     the volatile trailing message, which is the part a cache CANNOT reuse, so
     it is billed in full on every step. A hundred-step repo job pays it a
     hundred times: the work contract is ~745 tokens on turn 1 and ~175 on
     continuations, and losing that split costs ~70k tokens per long job.

# Ceilings, not exact values: prose should be free to change, size should not.
# CEILINGS RAISED DELIBERATELY at v1.2.0.0, and this is the accounting.
# +~800 tokens on every turn, in three named pieces, none of which can be
# lazy-loaded without breaking the thing it was added for:
#
#   · the TASK LEDGER (plan_set/plan_step/plan_status, ~180 tok). The
#     turn-ending gates read this ledger. A turn that never loaded the specs
#     cannot be held open by it when work is unfinished, nor released by it
#     when work is done — which is the whole fix for "stops early" and
#     "answers twice". Lazy-loading the mechanism that decides whether the
#     turn ends is not an option.
#   · REAL SEARCH (web_search/web_research/browser_status, ~230 tok). Reached
#     for on nearly every question of fact; the text it REPLACED (the
#     hand-rolled DuckDuckGo URL playbook) is gone, so the net is smaller
#     than the gross.
#   · the ACTING rules (~180 tok): don't ask permission, don't hedge, finish
#     the whole job. These exist to stop turns that produce nothing, so they
#     pay for themselves in round-trips rather than costing them.
#
# The workspace group is NOT in this number: it is preloaded only when a repo
# is actually open (see build_system_prompt's preload_groups), which is the
# one place where paying for specs inline is cheaper than a load_tools
# round-trip that will always be made anyway.
