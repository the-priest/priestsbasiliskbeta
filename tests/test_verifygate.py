test_verifygate.py — a turn that changed a repo and never ran anything is not
finished, whatever it says.

WHY THIS EXISTS
===============
WORK MODE's contract already tells the model to verify, at length:
"VERIFY, DON'T ASSUME", "ITERATE UNTIL IT ACTUALLY PASSES". That is advice,
and advice is what a model drops on step forty of a long job. Anthropic's
guidance names both the failure and the split:

    "Claude stops when the work looks done. Without a check it can run,
     'looks done' is the only signal available, and you become the
     verification loop."

...and: a prompt instruction is advisory; a Stop hook is deterministic and
"blocks the turn from ending until it passes".

Basilisk already HAD the check. `workspace_verify` re-runs the repo's tests and
classifies the result against a baseline, so it reports what you fixed AND what
you broke. The gap was never the check — it was that nothing made the turn go
through it.

THE SHAPE
=========
This is the promise gate's architecture aimed at the other half of the product,
and it inherits the property that made that one hold up: IT DOES NOT READ THE
REPLY. Every earlier attempt at "did it really finish?" was a better reader of
the model's prose, and each was one phrasing away from failing. Two facts
decide it — files were written this request, and nothing was ever run to check
them.
