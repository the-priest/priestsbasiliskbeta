test_evidence_scope.py — the evidence ledger must detect tampering, and the
scope gate must judge a RANGE as a range.

FOUND BY AUDIT, ALL REPRODUCED BEFORE FIXING
============================================

LEDGER (basilisk_ledger.py) — this is what "no proof, no finding" rests on,
and every benchmark number in the README was produced with it.

  1. verify() was BLIND whenever a recorded hash was None. A step whose stdout
     was empty records `stdout_sha256: None`, and the check read
         e.get("stdout_sha256") in (None, _sha256(so))
     which is unconditionally true when the recorded value is None. Forged
     output could be pasted into that artifact and verify() still said intact.

  2. verify() raised a FALSE "hash mismatch" on untouched evidence. It
     re-derived stdout/stderr by string-splitting the human-readable artifact
     on "\\n# --- stderr ---\\n", so any captured output containing that literal
     split the file in the wrong place. The tool contract actively tells
     Basilisk to read its own prior artifacts, so this was reachable in normal
     use — and the ledger accused itself.

  Both have one root cause: the integrity check RE-DERIVED the payload instead
  of hashing what was written. It now hashes the artifact bytes. Legacy events
  (no artifact_sha256) still verify via the section path, with the None hole
  closed.

SCOPE (basilisk_scope.py / basilisk_ext/engage.py) — the authorisation
boundary for an autonomous scanner.

  3. `_strip_to_host` split on "/" to drop a URL path and ate the CIDR PREFIX
     with it, so `10.0.0.0/8` was judged as the single address `10.0.0.0`.
     With scope 10.0.0.0/24 that ALLOWED a 16.7-million-host sweep.

  4. Exclusions used the authorisation test (containment), so `nmap
     10.0.0.0/24` was allowed while the single excluded host 10.0.0.1 inside
     it was correctly refused — the carve-out could be stepped over by naming
     the range around it. Exclusions now use OVERLAP.

  5. IP rules were compared as STRINGS, so `2001:db8::1` and
     `2001:db8:0:0:0:0:0:1` — one host — compared unequal.

  basilisk_scope and basilisk_ext.engage are documented as lockstep twins, and
  divergence is itself a bypass (the gate refuses while scope_check tells the
  operator he is in scope). Both were fixed together and the agreement is
  asserted here.

# ── 7. FOUR MORE FAIL-OPENS, ALL REPRODUCED BEFORE FIXING ────────────
# Found by reading, not by a failing test — the suite was fully green.
#
#  A. `find`, `docker`, `git`, `make`, `go` sat in _TOOL_NAME_CONSUMERS, the
#     set that means "this head only NAMES a tool" (`which nmap`). They also
#     EXECUTE what follows, and being on that list skipped both the quoted-arg
#     recursion and the unattributed-tool backstop.
#  B. `os.sep in t` treated every token containing "/" as a filename, so a
#     scheme-less URL disappeared from the extracted set and one in-scope
#     operand laundered an out-of-scope one.
#  C. `-f` was in _BOOLEAN_FLAGS *and* _TARGET_FILE_FLAGS, and the file branch
#     is tested first — so it swallowed the next token. This one is a FALSE
#     REFUSAL on everyday in-scope work, which is the failure mode that gets a
#     gate switched off, so it is a security cost too.
#  D. bash's /dev/tcp/<host>/<port> reaches the network with no binary at all,
#     and the gate keys entirely off recognising a tool basename.
