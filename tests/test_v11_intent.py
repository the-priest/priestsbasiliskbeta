"""test_v11_intent.py — adversarial sweep of leashed_intent + forced_search_url.

Written as a probe during the v1.1.0.0 debug pass and kept, because it found
thirteen real defects on its first run — including a structural one: several
words (`build`, `run`, `test`, `patch`, `import`, `commit`, `merge`, `diff`)
are legitimately BOTH weak verbs and code nouns, so the leading verb satisfied
its own object requirement and "build me a mental model of tcp" classified as
a repo job.

Wrong in the "task" direction puts workspace/iterate instructions on a plain
question; wrong in the "question" direction and the coding assistant goes back
to describing fixes instead of landing them. Both are hunted here.
