test_repeatwindow.py — the repeat guard was blocking the loop the product is
built around.

THE BUG
=======
`workspace_verify {}` takes no arguments, so _action_label returns the constant
string "workspace_verify". The repeat guard refuses a THIRD identical action.
The action log is only reset when a MISSION latches, which never happens in
leashed work mode.

Therefore: in a repo job, the third `workspace_verify` was refused, and every
one after it, for the life of the chat.

Meanwhile the persona says of that exact tool, in the model's own instructions:

    <tool name="workspace_verify">{}</tool>  // ... Call after every edit.
    //   6. workspace_verify. Every time.

The instructions mandated a behaviour the guard forbade. Same for
`run: pytest -q`, and for `oracle_status {}` ("Consult it every planning turn"),
and for every other no-argument status read.

It is also what made the new verification gate unreliable: the gate synthesises
`workspace_verify`, the guard could refuse it, and the gate's one-shot was spent
on a refusal.

THE RULE
========
The guard's docstring was right about a SCANNER and wrong about a VERIFIER.
nmap against the same host three times tells you nothing new; workspace_verify
after a third edit tells you something completely new, because the thing it
measures changed underneath it. The guard compared labels, so it could not tell
them apart.

So it counts a WINDOW: runs of this action since the last DIFFERENT
state-changing action. An action never resets its OWN window — which is what
keeps `pytest, pytest, pytest` blocked while `edit, pytest, edit, pytest` runs
forever.
