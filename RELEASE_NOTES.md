# v1.2.0.9

**THE root cause of the empty loop, found and fixed: DeepSeek's own tool-call
syntax was only decoded with its EXACT special characters, and those degrade on
the wire. Plus a model-walk escape hatch as a second line of defence, native
function-calling off by default again, and empty call wrappers scrubbed from the
display.**

**The bug that survived every previous "fix," because it was never the model:
the operator switched to V4-Flash and got the SAME loop, which proves it.**
DeepSeek's V4/V4.1-Flash family emit tool calls in their trained native syntax —
special tokens built from a FULLWIDTH PIPE (`｜`, U+FF5C) and a `▁` separator:
`<｜tool▁call▁begin｜>…<｜tool▁sep｜>web_read…`. Those characters **degrade on the
way through the tokenizer and the wire**: the pipe becomes an ASCII `|`, a box
`│`, or a doubled `||`; the `▁` separator becomes an underscore
(`<|tool_call_begin|>`). The DSML dialect had already been hardened for exactly
this — it matches a *class* of pipe characters — but this second native dialect,
the one V4/V4.1 actually emit, was still pinned to the one canonical pipe **and**
the one canonical separator. So the instant either degraded, the call was
**neither parsed nor recognised**: the tool never ran, the model got back
nothing, and it re-tried the same call for ever. That is the "said it would and
didn't," the empty replies, and the raw pipes-and-boxes on screen — all one bug,
and it hit every DeepSeek model because the syntax is the model's, not the id's.

The fix matches the **same character classes the DSML path already trusts** — any
pipe glyph, `▁` or `_` as the separator, single or doubled — gated by the literal
`tool` keyword so ordinary prose containing `<|x|>` is never touched. Every
degraded variant now decodes to a real call *and* strips cleanly, so parse and
strip stay in agreement and nothing raw reaches the screen. Reproduced verbatim
first (six pipe/separator degradations, plus the prose-then-call shape from the
screenshots), then pinned in `test_toolsyntax.py` so it cannot come back.

**Second line of defence: a model that still returns EMPTY gets walked to the
next model, instead of asked the same thing until it gives up.** An empty reply
is a clean HTTP 200, so the backend's own fallback chain (which only walks on
HTTP *errors*) never triggered — the host just re-asked the same model three
times. Now the first degraded retry stays put (cheap shot at a one-off hiccup)
and any retry after that **walks the provider's own chain** — V4.1-Flash →
V4-Flash → GLM-5.3-Flash — via a one-turn override that never touches your saved
model and resets on the next question. Same provider, never a cross-cloud hop.
This also covers a provider that silently strips `enable_thinking:false` (the
model comes back empty; the walk escalates to one that answers).

**Native function-calling is off by default again — because on the live setup it
made things worse, not better. The text protocol is the default it always was,
back to the behaviour that worked before any of this. Native stays wired as an
opt-in for anyone who wants it.**

**The honest version of what happened.** v1.2.0.8 turned native tool-calling ON
by default and made it "whole" — the whole conversation restructured into
`assistant.tool_calls` + `role:"tool"` messages, exactly the way DeepSeek's own
harness drives the family. On paper that is the correct way to drive V4/V4.1. On
*this* operator's live SiliconFlow endpoint it regressed: the model emitted empty
`<calls></calls>` wrappers and fell back into the say-nothing loop — the exact
failure the whole effort was meant to kill. The reference-correct path and the
path that actually works on the wire were not the same path. So this release
**treats the cause, not the symptom, and reverts the default**: `native_tool_calls`
is **OFF**, the text `<tool>` protocol is the driver again — the behaviour from
before any of these changes went in, which is what the operator reported working.
Native is still fully wired (`structure_tool_messages`, the reject-and-degrade
floor, the structured-`tool_calls` reader) and one flip away in **Settings →
Backends** for an endpoint where it helps; it is just no longer forced on
everyone by default.

**Empty `<calls></calls>` wrappers are scrubbed from what you see.** If a model
ever emits a bare, argument-less `<calls>`/`<tool_calls>` wrapper — nothing to
dispatch — it is stripped from the visible reply instead of being rendered as
debris. This is a **display-only** clean-up in `scrub_tool_debris`; it does not
touch the parse path, so a real tool call carrying a body is unaffected, and
content that legitimately contains the literal text `<calls>` is not corrupted
(the earlier, too-aggressive global strip that broke round-tripping was reverted
in favour of this narrow, empty-wrapper-only rule).

**The follow-through gate skips consent-wall and aggregator hosts.** The gate
that turns a search into a read (so "give me news" ends on a story, not a page of
links) now skips `yahoo.com`, `msn.com`, `reddit.com` and known consent/redirect
walls when it picks the top result to follow itself — those hosts return a cookie
wall or an interstitial with HTTP 200, which is not a real read. It follows the
first result that is an actual article.

**Deep debug pass.** Full suite re-run green after the revert; ruff `F,E9` scan
clean (no undefined names, no syntax errors anywhere); GUARDRAIL byte-identical;
CSS parses under real GTK and stays ASCII-only. The self-referential
`test_repofix` failure (a comment in `basilisk_core.py` that literally contained
a `<tool …>{…}</tool>` tag, which the test embeds and re-parses) was fixed by
rewording the comment.

**5,140 assertions across 83 suites**, zero red. New coverage in
`test_toolsyntax.py` (every degraded DeepSeek pipe/separator parses AND strips
clean — the root-cause fix) and a new `test_degraded_walk.py` (the model-walk
escape: the router `model_override` reaches the wire with thinking-off following
the final model, and the chain walk is finite and same-provider). GUARDRAIL
byte-identical.

# v1.2.0.8

**Native function-calling done the way DeepSeek actually specifies — whole, not
half. Plus the mic button back, Camoufox driven from its on-disk binary, and a
follow-through gate so a search always becomes a read.**

**Native tool-calling, done right.** The earlier attempt sent the OpenAI `tools`
schema but still fed the conversation *history* back as `<tool_result>` TEXT — so
the model saw two conflicting channels (schema says "call", history says
"narrate") and did the worst thing: it wrote "let me read the page" turn after
turn and never emitted the call. That is now fixed at the cause. When tools are
in play, the **entire conversation the model sees is structured**: every prior
tool call is an `assistant.tool_calls` message and every result a `role:"tool"`
message with the matching `tool_call_id` (`structure_tool_messages`). One
consistent channel, exactly as DeepSeek's own harness drives the V4/V4.1 family.

The transform is **valid by construction** — an assistant call is only
structured when the exact tool-result messages it needs immediately follow it;
anything that can't be paired (an in-flight call, a bare system note) is left as
text — so the request can never contain a dangling `tool_calls` or an orphan
`role:"tool"`, the two shapes an API rejects. The text `<tool>` protocol stays
wired as an automatic fallback and a provider that rejects the field
strips-and-retries onto plain text, so it is the native path with a floor under
it. It's back ON by default.

**A follow-through gate so a search always becomes a read.** Even with the
channel fixed, an open-ended "give me news" could leave the model with a page of
search *results* (sites, not stories). If the reply intends a fetch, a search
already ran, and the model emits no call, the host now **follows the top result
itself** (decoding the real URL out of the results page) — the exact step the
model kept saying it would take and didn't. Bounded so it advances the read
without becoming its own loop.

**The mic button is back.** It had been removed from the composer while all the
record→transcribe machinery stayed, so the feature existed with no way to reach
it. Tap to record, tap to stop → the clip is transcribed (SiliconFlow SenseVoice
or Groq Whisper, per Settings → Voice) and dropped into the composer; with
Auto-send on it sends straight away. Pinned by a test so it can't vanish again.

**Camoufox works from its on-disk binary.** The reported case — the browser
present in `~/.cache/camoufox` but `import camoufox` returning `None`, so
`web_read` fell back to plain HTTP — is fixed by a new `camoufox-bin` engine that
drives that binary directly through Playwright. `browser_status` reports the
path, the diagnostic names the one-line fix, and `install.sh` sets up the browser
stack on a fresh box.

**Security fix:** the `.gitignore` on the pushed repo was missing the
`settings.json` exclusion (which holds API keys). Restored — keys can't be
committed.

**5,025 assertions across 82 suites**, zero red. GUARDRAIL byte-identical.

# v1.2.0.6

**Claude-coloured dark theme, the Camoufox browser fixed, and the code-writing
loop killed at the root.**

**The GUI is Claude-coloured now.** The accent had migrated red -> blue -> grey
and a token-only change last round left the *thirty-two* hardcoded grey accent
hexes (`#45484a`, `#292a2b`, and their `rgba(69,72,74,…)` glows, 90 uses in all)
untouched in the custom widgets — which is exactly why it "still looked black and
grey." Those are now Claude's clay/coral: `#d97757` carries every highlight
(focus, links, switches, selection, glows, the ready-dot), suggested-action
buttons fill with `#c15f3c` on white, and the near-black neutrals are warmed a
touch toward charcoal. Danger red, warning amber and success green are semantic
and were left untouched. Verified: parses under real GTK 4.14, ASCII-only, and
pinned by a new `test_theme.py` so it can't silently revert.

**Camoufox works when the browser is on disk but the package isn't.** The
reported case: `~/.cache/camoufox` held the whole Firefox tree (`camoufox-bin`,
`libxul.so`, …) but `import camoufox` returned `None`, so `web_read` dropped to
plain HTTP. New **`camoufox-bin`** engine tier drives that on-disk binary
directly through Playwright's `executable_path` — the browser you already have,
no package import needed. It sits second in the ladder
(camoufox -> camoufox-bin -> firefox -> chromium -> HTTP), `browser_status` now
reports the binary path, and the diagnostic tells you the one-line fix
(`pip install playwright` alone is enough to drive it). `install.sh` now sets up
playwright + camoufox so a fresh box has a real browser on day one.

**The code-writing loop ("propose_edit did not render (unparseable args)") is
fixed at the root.** When a big file was crammed into one call, the token cap cut
the JSON off mid-file and the call was unparseable — and the old correction told
the model to *re-send it as a single call*, so it re-sent the same giant blob and
truncated again, forever. Now the host reads the cut reason it already has and,
either way, **mandates small append chunks** — a concrete `write_file`
create-then-append recipe, with the target path recovered even from the
truncated call, so a call that only ever carries ~40 lines can never be cut off.
The persona was rewritten to match: the self-contradicting "content is the WHOLE
file, never a fragment" line (the thing that caused the giant blobs) is gone,
replaced by a chunk-first rule with a hard ~40-line ceiling.

**4,994 assertions across 82 suites**, zero red. New suites: `test_theme.py`;
new coverage in `test_browsersearch.py` (camoufox-bin) and `test_truncwrite.py`
(the chunk-steering correction). GUARDRAIL byte-identical.

---

# v1.2.0.5

**Three models, a real loop-termination bug fixed, and an aggressive debug pass.**

**The catalogue is now three models, on purpose.** The operator cut it to the
three he actually runs: **DeepSeek-V4.1-Flash** (the new default and the best of
them), **DeepSeek-V4-Flash** (the measured 87/113 build, immediate fallback),
and **GLM-5.3-Flash** (the one-click alternative). Everything else is gone from
the picker and the fallback chain. `hard_engagement_model` ships empty — there
is no heavier sibling to escalate to now, so a heavy turn just deepens the
reasoning dial (on GLM) or keeps the bigger token budget (on DeepSeek, which
steers with `enable_thinking`, not a depth dial). The vision picker and the
default vision model point at GLM-5.3-Flash, the one kept model that takes
images. The live-catalogue recovery still exists, so a hand-typed id that 404s
still self-heals.

**The bug that made it "full of bugs": the degraded-reply loop didn't stop when
it said it did.** When the model returned empty several times (a provider
hiccup, a blocked fetch — the "cant even fetch news" case), the retries-exhausted
branch wrote "I couldn't get a usable reply — tap send to try again" and then
**fell through** into the force-answer path: it orphaned that message, re-locked
tools, and kicked up to two more turns — each re-entering the degraded block with
a **fresh** three-retry budget. A three-retry ceiling was really about eleven
round-trips, and the app printed "giving up" while visibly carrying on. It now
finishes the turn and returns where it says it does. And both degraded dead-ends
write a visible, honest message into the reply instead of leaving a blank bubble.

**Aggressive debug pass** (a subagent audited every changed path and ran the full
suite):

- Native-tools rejection now degrades on **422** as well as 400 (some
  OpenAI-compatible servers reject an unsupported `tools` field with 422), so it
  still falls back to the text protocol instead of dying.
- The repeat-guard content fingerprint now also covers `workspace_replace`'s
  alias argument names (`new_str`/`old_str`/`replace`/`find`), closing the last
  gap where three distinct alias-form edits of one file could false-block.
- Confirmed no dangling runtime reference to any removed model, no double
  dispatch across the structured + text tool channels, and that the
  reasoning-stream recovery never fires on an ordinary prose reply.

**4,965 assertions across 81 suites**, zero red. GUARDRAIL byte-identical.

# v1.2.0.4

**Native function-calling — driving the model the way DeepSeek says to, and the
way Claude Code / opencode / DeepSeek's own app do.**

v1.2.0.3 stopped the empty-reply loop. This makes the model *good* at tool use
instead of merely surviving it. DeepSeek's V4/V4.1 family is trained for the
OpenAI `tools` flow: the harness declares the tools as function schemas in the
request, and the model replies with structured `tool_calls`. Basilisk had only
ever used a text `<tool>` protocol and never sent a `tools` array — so the model
was guessing a convention instead of doing what it was trained for, which is
where a lot of the "dumb shit on screen" came from.

Now Basilisk sends a real `tools` schema, **built from the same system prompt
the model is about to read** — so it lists exactly the tools the model was told
about (the leashed and armed tool sets track automatically) and can never
advertise a phantom one. Each tool's parameters and types are lifted from the
persona's own example JSON; the `//` comment becomes the description.

Three properties make this safe rather than a gamble:

- **The text protocol is still the floor.** The persona still documents it, the
  canonicaliser still parses it, and the dispatcher's argument aliasing still
  absorbs any drift — so nothing regresses if the model mixes channels (which
  DeepSeek's own tracker notes it sometimes does).
- **A provider that rejects `tools` degrades automatically.** A 400 naming the
  tools field strips it, retries the *same* model on the text protocol, and
  remembers not to send it again that session — the model is never abandoned
  over an unsupported field.
- **It is a setting.** `native_tool_calls` is on by default and off in one flip;
  sidecar completions never send tools.

Combined with v1.2.0.3's structured-`tool_calls` reader and reasoning-stream
recovery, the model is now driven, and read back, exactly the way the reference
harnesses do it.

**GUI:** the brief was "pro coding-terminal vibes, not a black-and-white movie —
change colour and texture a bit, keep the structure." So the v1.2.0.3 serif
title-card experiment is reverted, a **muted phosphor-green terminal accent**
(desaturated, restrained to highlights — focus, links, switches, the ready-dot)
replaces the flat grey, and the near-black surfaces get a **faint top-to-bottom
gradient** for depth instead of a flat fill. Danger red and warning amber are
untouched. Verified: parses clean under real GTK 4.14, ASCII-only bytes literal.

**4,961 assertions across 81 suites**, zero red. New suite:
`test_nativetools.py` (schema build, payload wiring, the reject-and-degrade
path, the router gates). GUARDRAIL byte-identical.

# v1.2.0.3

**The one where V4.1-Flash actually builds the game. From a live build the
operator filmed failing the same way over and over — every fault reproduced
first, then fixed at the root.**

The symptom was brutal and repeatable: ask V4.1-Flash to build a small game and
it "thought for 50,000 characters and said nothing", forever. Three separate
mechanisms were behind it.

## 1. Thinking was ON for exactly the turns that couldn't afford it

The DeepSeek V4/V4.1-Flash family default to a **thinking** mode. In an agentic
tool loop that is the wrong default — the model spends its whole `max_tokens`
budget reasoning and streams back an **empty** answer: no prose, no tool call.
The host saw "reasoning present, content empty", called it degraded, and
retried — which changes nothing, so it looped.

The toggle that turns thinking off (`enable_thinking:false`) existed, but it was
only ever sent on a **light** turn that had *also* opted into `fast_light_turns`.
A build is a **standard/heavy** turn, so on every build the toggle was never
sent. **Now thinking is off by default on any model that has a `think_off`**
(the whole DeepSeek Flash family), on *every* turn — which is how DeepSeek's own
agent harness runs them for tool use. `deepseek_thinking:true` turns it back on
for anyone who wants it. GLM-5.3-Flash is untouched: its reasoning has no
switch, so it keeps steering on `reasoning_effort`.

## 2. A tool call that arrives in the reasoning stream is no longer lost

Two independent backstops, because a provider can still route a call into the
reasoning channel:

- **Structured `delta.tool_calls` are read.** DeepSeek's harness consumes tool
  calls from the OpenAI-style structured channel; so do we now. The streamed
  fragments are reassembled and rendered into the **same** `<tool …>` text every
  other dialect is folded to, so one parser and one dispatcher handle all of
  them — even when `content` came back empty.
- **The reasoning stream is re-parsed.** If a turn ends with an empty answer and
  no call, the host runs the *same* canonicaliser over the captured reasoning; a
  real call the model emitted while thinking is recovered and dispatched instead
  of feeding the degraded-retry loop.

## 3. The repeat guard stopped refusing legitimate re-writes

Writing `index.html`, improving it, and writing it again is three **different**
actions — but the guard labelled them all `write_file: index.html` and refused
the third ("already run 2× — not running it again"), which is the block the
operator filmed. The label for a content-writing tool now carries a **fingerprint
of the content**, so iterating on one file never false-blocks, while a
byte-identical re-write (which genuinely tells you nothing new) still collapses
to one label and is still caught. `run` is deliberately unchanged — its command
*is* its label, so `pytest`/`pytest`/`pytest` still blocks.

## 4. Persona: the build mistakes that cost a whole run

Standing rules added for building an app or game from scratch: a build script
must **never read its own output** (that is what doubled `index.html`); **data
belongs in its own file**, never only inside the page you are about to rewrite
(that is how the champion/item table got destroyed); and **guard every lookup**
so the first frame doesn't crash on `cannot read x of undefined`.

## Numbers

**4,936 assertions across 80 suites**, zero red. One new suite:
`test_structcalls.py` (the structured-call fold, the reasoning recovery, and the
repeat-guard fingerprint, end to end). `test_effort.py` was rewritten around the
new think-off default. The immutable `GUARDRAIL` block is byte-identical.

---

# v1.2.0.2

**Theme: neutral graphite. He said the blue was boring — dark gray and black now.**

The obsidian-glass theme was a cool blue band (a hue migration off the original
red at v1.1.1.0). This neutralises the whole blue/cyan/indigo band to gray while
preserving every lightness and alpha value, so the glass structure — the lit
edges, the depth, the one-hairline composure — is untouched; only the tint is
gone. Applied identically to three places so nothing is left blue:

- **The stylesheet** (462 hex + 620 rgba values in the ASCII bytes literal).
- **The brand + app PNGs** (emblem, wordmark, avatar, watermark, every button)
  — per-pixel, so the emblem's glow is silver on black instead of blue.
- **The 4 blue SVGs and the 11 embedded base64 button PNGs** in
  `basilisk_btn_art.py`, so a remote-fetch install with no assets dir gets the
  gray buttons too — the on-disk and embedded art stay in lockstep, same rule
  as the v1.1.1.0 migration.

**Semantic colour is untouched:** danger red (`#e5484d`) and warning amber
(`#f0a500`) sit outside the neutralised band and stay loud — red still means
danger and nothing else. Verified: 0 saturated blue hexes left in the CSS, CSS
parses clean under real GTK 4.14, ASCII-only bytes literal intact, GUARDRAIL
byte-identical.

Everything below is the v1.2.0.1 write-up, unchanged.

---

# v1.2.0.1

**Follow-up to v1.2.0.0, from a real "build me a game" run that failed. Five
fixes, all reproduced first.**

The operator asked it to build a MOBA at `~/Documents/moba` and watched it fail
in the terminal log. Every failure was real and traced to one of these:

1. **Long files were written with a `run` heredoc, and heredocs truncate.** The
   model did `cat > index.html << EOF …` inside a `run` call; the reply hit the
   token cap mid-file, the JSON string was left unterminated, and the call
   collapsed to `{"_raw": …}` — refused with a useless "missing argument
   ['command']" that sent it to re-issue the same giant heredoc. Fixed at the
   root: **`write_file` now writes long files in sections** even for `.py` (a
   mid-sequence chunk that doesn't parse yet is accepted and reports
   `parses:false` instead of being refused — the old refusal is what made
   sectioned Python impossible and pushed the model to heredocs), it
   **creates parent directories** so no `mkdir -p` dance, and an undecodable
   `run` call now says plainly *the reply was cut off — use write_file in
   append sections, never a heredoc.* The persona says the same.

2. **"make me a moba game" classified as a QUESTION, not a task** — so no work
   mode, no plan, and the checklist/objectives he expected never appeared. The
   intent classifier had no vocabulary for the things he builds. Now
   `make/build/create/code/design/develop me a game|app|website|clone|bot|…`
   is a build task, with zero new false positives on "what is a moba" /
   "make a sandwich" / "make a case for X".

3. **A SiliconFlow HTTP 500 killed the turn.** `{"code":50500,"message":
   "Request failed: Unknown error.","data":null}` is a provider-side hiccup,
   but 500 wasn't in the transient-retry set (only 502/503 were), so the turn
   died with a red toast mid-build. The whole **5xx range now walks the
   fallback chain**, so a single-model 500 self-heals onto the fallback and a
   provider-wide outage still surfaces the real error instead of spinning.
   *(To answer the operator's question directly: that 500 was SiliconFlow's
   fault, not the app's — but the app should survive it, and now does.)*

4. **DeepSeek-V4.1-Flash added and made the default**, at the operator's
   instruction — DeepSeek's Sep-2026 refresh of the V4-Flash line, confirmed
   live on SiliconFlow (`deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-V4.1-Flash`). Same vendor, same
   tool-call dialect, so every V4 behaviour (the DSML/native canonicaliser,
   `enable_thinking`, the sampling profile) applies unchanged — verified. The
   benchmarked **V4-Flash is the immediate fallback**, its 87/113 provenance
   intact and *not* restated as V4.1's, and the backend recovers from a wrong
   model id (a 404 refetches the live catalogue), so even a slug mismatch
   degrades to V4-Flash rather than dying. Existing installs keep their saved
   model; only fresh installs move.

5. **GLM-5.3-Flash parity re-verified** — 90/90 of its dedicated suite green;
   V4.1 correctly does *not* use GLM's reasoning-effort dial, and GLM correctly
   still does.

Everything below is the v1.2.0.0 write-up, unchanged.

---

# v1.2.0.0

**The coding-assistant release. A real browser, real search, a task ledger the
turn loop actually reads, and the repo tools a long job needs.**

The brief was three reported faults and one direction:

> "it still sometimes stops when it's supposed to keep working and it still
> doesn't stop when it's supposed to and sends two answers" — and make leashed
> mode a proper coding and general assistant.

All three faults turned out to be the same missing mechanism.

---

## 1. The turn loop stopped guessing

Nothing in the app ever knew **what the model set out to do**, so "is this turn
finished?" could only be answered by reading the reply's prose. A prose reader
is always one phrasing away from being wrong — and it was wrong in *both*
directions at once:

* `"I've fixed two of the five files. The remaining three need the same
  treatment."` — the stall detector says no stall (correctly: nothing was
  announced), the conclusion detector says no conclusion. Nothing pushed, the
  turn **ended**, three files untouched.
* A complete, finished answer that happened to mention a next step got nudged,
  and the model answered the same question again.

**The task ledger** (`basilisk_ext/tasks.py`) replaces the reading with state
the app owns. The model declares a plan; every item has a status; and the
turn-ending decision becomes arithmetic:

| ledger state | what the host does |
|---|---|
| any item **open** or **doing** | the turn **will not end** — it is pushed back to work, bounded at 6 pushes |
| every item **closed** (done / blocked / dropped) | the turn **ends**, and every other push is suppressed for the rest of the request |

`blocked` and `dropped` both **close** an item and both demand a reason. A
ledger whose only exit is `done` is an infinite loop with extra steps.

The plan renders as a live checklist in the activity feed, ticking off as it
works.

## 2. "Not done until it passes" now includes *what the check said*

v1.1.3.0 made the turn **run** the verifier. Nothing made it care about the
result — so "edit, verify, tests are red, write an honest paragraph about the
tests being red, end the turn" was a perfectly reachable path, and it left the
repo worse than it started while reading as diligence.

`workspace_verify` returns a structured verdict, so the new gate reads a fact:
a turn ending on `broke` non-empty is pushed back to fix it. The verdict is
captured in `_feed_tool_result` — the one choke point every tool result passes
through — not from the model's account of it.

## 3. The second answer

Both end-of-turn gates fire at the same moment: a **complete reply** has been
written, no tool call was emitted, the turn was about to end. The gate then
runs a tool anyway and hands back the result.

From the model's side that is indistinguishable from an ordinary mid-research
tool result, so it does the sensible thing and writes the answer. The answer it
already wrote. Two complete answers, one question — exactly as reported.

The gates were right to fire. What was missing was the one fact only the host
has: **the first answer is already on screen.** Gate-forced continuations now
say so, and ask for the delta — a line confirming the check, or a correction if
the check changed the answer.

## 4. A real browser behind `web_read`

`web_read` was one urllib GET: no JavaScript, a bot-shaped TLS fingerprint, a
static User-Agent. A JS-rendered page came back as an empty shell and an
anti-bot edge came back as a challenge page with **HTTP 200** on it. Neither
looks like a failure from the inside, which is what made them expensive — the
model read "blank" and either guessed or re-fetched until the repeat guard
stopped it.

`web_read` now renders in **Camoufox** (a hardened Firefox), falling back to
Playwright Firefox, then Chromium, then plain HTTP — and the result **says
which reader served it**, so "this page was empty" can be told from "this page
was not really read".

The SSRF floor is **injected, not reimplemented**: `browser.fetch` refuses to
run without the host's own predicate, and applies it to every redirect hop and
every subresource the page requests, aborting and *reporting* each one. There
is one definition of "private address" in the tree.

## 5. Search that behaves like research

There was no search tool — search was a hand-written DuckDuckGo URL, one query,
one engine, read the first plausible link. Four things go wrong with that, and
the worst is silent: when two sources conflict, reading only one makes the
conflict invisible.

* **`web_research`** — one call: several phrasings, several independent
  engines, top results from **different domains**, read, plus an `agreement`
  block naming the values more than one source carried. It does not decide
  what is true; it reports that four sources say 7.95 and one says 7.94.
* **`web_search`** — merged, de-duplicated links ranked by cross-engine
  agreement rather than any one engine's order.
* **`browser_status`** — which reader is serving `web_read`, for when a page
  comes back empty.

Both route their fetches through the same gated reader as a direct `web_read`.

## 6. Repo work that does not hit a ceiling

Three ceilings, one symptom ("long code keeps failing"):

* **`workspace_edits`** — many exact edits to one file in one call,
  **all-or-nothing**. A rename across nine call sites is one call, not nine
  round-trips. If any anchor is missing or ambiguous, or the result would not
  parse, nothing is written and the error names which edit.
* **`workspace_append`** — the long-file protocol. A whole-file write has to
  fit in one reply, so anything past a few hundred lines was cut off at
  `max_tokens` and landed truncated. First chunk with `create`, then append.
  No size limit.
* **`workspace_insert`**, **`workspace_glob`**, **`workspace_read_many`** —
  positional insert, find-by-name, and batch read.
* **`run` executes with the repo as its working directory**, so `pytest -q`
  just works and the model stops prefixing commands with a guessed `cd`.
* The workspace specs now **ship inline when a repo is open** instead of
  costing a `load_tools` round-trip that would always be made anyway.

## 7. Less restrained, and quieter to look at

The persona now defaults to **acting**: no asking whether to continue, no
permission theatre for work already implied by the request, no hedging a
finding it verified. What it did *not* verify is still labelled unverified just
as plainly — those are the same rule.

The stylesheet gets a **quiet pass**: darker grounds (panels darker than the
frame, not lighter), near-neutral chrome, and drop shadows kept only where
something genuinely floats. Verified against real GTK 4.14: **0 CSS parse
errors**, ASCII-only bytes literal intact.

## Also fixed, found on the way

* **`.gitignore` no longer excluded `settings.json`** — the file that holds API
  keys. Caught by `test_secrets.py`; restored.
* **A corrupted SVG on the website.** A past version-bump `sed` matched inside
  path data and turned three `a1 1 0 0 1` arc commands into `a1.1.4.0 1`. The
  icon could not render. Repaired, and this release's version bump is anchored
  so it cannot recur.
* **`read_many` silently raised an unusably small `max_chars`** — now reported.
* `install.sh`'s `EXT_FILES` gained the three new sidecar modules (a missing
  entry is fatal in remote-fetch mode).

## Numbers

**4,770 assertions across 79 suites**, zero red. Four new suites:
`test_tasks.py`, `test_plangate.py`, `test_browsersearch.py`,
`test_repotools.py`.

The system prompt grew ~800 tokens: the ledger (~180), real search (~230), and
the acting rules (~180) — all three used on nearly every turn, none of them
lazy-loadable without breaking what they were added for. The workspace group is
**not** in that number; it ships only when a repo is open.

The immutable `GUARDRAIL` block is byte-identical
(`sha256 0ccebd17786bfaaf…`).
